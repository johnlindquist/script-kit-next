# Research Task: Current File Watcher Implementation

Explore the current codebase to understand how file watching is implemented:

1. Find all files related to file watching (look for `watcher.rs`, `notify`, file system watching patterns)
2. Identify what directories are currently being watched
3. Document the current approach to detecting file changes
4. Look for any existing app folder watching logic

Focus on: src/watcher.rs, any notify crate usage, and how scripts/apps are reloaded on change.
