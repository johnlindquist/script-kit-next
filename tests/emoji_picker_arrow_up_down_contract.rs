//! Source-level contract for the Run 2 Pass #35
//! `emoji-picker-up-down-arrow-nav` user story.
//!
//! User report (2026-04-17): the emoji picker grid was unreachable via
//! the Up/Down arrow keys when the filter input held focus. Left/Right
//! already worked — the `intercept_keystrokes` handler at
//! `src/app_impl/startup.rs` has an inline Left/Right block (around the
//! `no_direction_modifiers` branch) that detects `AppView::EmojiPickerView`,
//! advances `selected_index`, scrolls the emoji list, and calls
//! `cx.stop_propagation()` BEFORE the Input widget can consume the
//! keystroke for text-cursor movement. The Up/Down match that runs next
//! had arms for every other grid/list view (ClipboardHistoryView,
//! AppLauncherView, WindowSwitcherView, BrowserTabsView, DesignGalleryView,
//! ThemeChooserView, ProcessManagerView, SettingsView, AcpHistoryView,
//! BrowserHistoryView, DictationHistoryView, NotesBrowseView,
//! CurrentAppCommandsView, SearchAiPresetsView, ScriptList) but NO arm
//! for `AppView::EmojiPickerView`. Up/Down keystrokes therefore fell
//! through the catchall `_ => { /* Don't intercept arrows for other
//! views (let normal handling work) */ }`, which means the Input widget
//! received them and silently used them for text-cursor movement — a
//! no-op against an empty or single-line filter. The grid's
//! `selected_index` never changed and the visible selection never moved.
//!
//! The stale comment `// Called from startup_new_arrow.rs interceptor`
//! atop `navigate_emoji_picker` (src/render_builtins/emoji_picker.rs)
//! pointed at a dead file (`src/app_impl/startup_new_arrow.rs` — never
//! `include!`d, never compiled) that DID contain a correct arm, which
//! is likely why the gap in the active interceptor went unnoticed: the
//! parallel file implied the arm existed somewhere in the tree.
//!
//! Pass #35 adds the missing `AppView::EmojiPickerView` arm in the
//! Up/Down branch of `src/app_impl/startup.rs`, using
//! `crate::emoji::build_emoji_grid_layout` + `EmojiNavDirection::Up/Down`
//! + `EmojiGridLayout::move_index` so navigation respects category-row
//! boundaries (the layout's `item_to_row` map) rather than the naive
//! `± GRID_COLS` arithmetic that the `simulateKey` path uses. The arm
//! also sets `input_mode = InputMode::Keyboard`, clears `hovered_index`,
//! calls `scroll_to_item(row, ScrollStrategy::Nearest)` on
//! `emoji_scroll_handle`, and calls `cx.stop_propagation()` so the
//! Input widget does NOT additionally process the keystroke.
//!
//! This contract test pins the arm's exact shape so a future mechanical
//! refactor of `startup.rs` cannot silently regress Up/Down emoji-grid
//! navigation back to the pre-Pass-#35 state.
