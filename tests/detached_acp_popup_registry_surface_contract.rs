//! Source-level contract for Run 2 Pass #46
//! `detached-popup-acp-surface-parity-contract`.
//!
//! Background: when the user detaches the ACP chat into its own popup
//! window (e.g. via the hotkey toggle on `AcpChatView`), the detach handler
//! in `src/ai/acp/chat_window.rs` registers the new popup in the automation
//! metadata registry via `upsert_automation_window`. The pair of fields
//! that identify this window to automation consumers is:
//!
//!   - `kind: AutomationWindowKind::AcpDetached` — the kind discriminator
//!     used by `listAutomationWindows` and target-by-kind resolution; this
//!     is how a consumer filters "detached popups" vs. "the main window".
//!   - `semantic_surface: Some("acpChat".to_string())` — the wire tag that
//!     says "this window hosts an ACP chat surface", parallel to the
//!     Main-hosted `AcpChatView` which also reports `semanticSurface =
//!     "acpChat"` (see `semantic_surface_for_main_view` in
//!     `src/main_sections/app_view_state.rs`).
//!
//! The parity is intentional: the SAME `semanticSurface` on BOTH window
//! kinds means a consumer that asks "where is ACP chat right now?" can
//! match on `semanticSurface == "acpChat"` regardless of whether the chat
//! is attached to Main or floating as a detached popup. The `kind` field
//! is the disambiguator when the consumer needs to target one specifically.
//! This is how existing automation tests target detached popups (e.g.
//! `tests/automation/detached_acp_targeting.rs` expects
//! `resolved.semantic_surface.as_deref() == Some("acpChat")` for a window
//! whose `kind == AcpDetached`).
//!
//! A future refactor that "clarifies" the surface by renaming the detached
//! popup's tag to e.g. `"acpDetached"` would silently diverge this
//! parity — consumers matching on `semanticSurface == "acpChat"` would
//! miss the detached window, and a swarm of existing tests that hardcode
//! `Some("acpChat")` on `AcpDetached` fixtures would have to be rewritten.
//! Divergence is a bigger, conscious API change, not a drive-by tweak.
//!
//! This contract pins the single production registration site so the
//! parity cannot silently drift:
//!   1. `src/ai/acp/chat_window.rs` contains EXACTLY ONE
//!      `upsert_automation_window` call whose body mentions both
//!      `AutomationWindowKind::AcpDetached` and
//!      `semantic_surface: Some("acpChat"...)`.
//!   2. No OTHER non-test source file registers a window with
//!      `AutomationWindowKind::AcpDetached` (which would fork the
//!      parity invariant).
//!
//! Complements:
//!   - `tests/automation/detached_acp_targeting.rs` — dynamic behavior
//!     test that asserts the resolved surface tag on a detached fixture.
//!   - `tests/dispatcher_semantic_surface_symmetry_contract.rs` — pins
//!     the Main-hosted half (`AcpChatView` → `"acpChat"`).
//!   - `removed-docs window behavior` — design doc.
