//! Source-level contract pinning the view-agnostic invariant of the
//! shared `triggerBuiltin` dispatcher — `dispatch_trigger_builtin_name`
//! + `apply_trigger_builtin` in `src/app_impl/trigger_builtin_dispatch.rs`.
//!
//! Run 9 Pass #16's A30 live-verified (fresh binary pid 30544) that
//! firing `triggerBuiltin browser-tabs` from INSIDE an active
//! `DesignGalleryView` session — with no intervening `hide`, `escape`,
//! or return-to-main — successfully flips the prompt to `browserTabs`
//! with `choiceCount:39, visible:39`. The cross-view in-place switch is
//! a documented design behavior: the single umbrella dispatcher does
//! NOT gate on `self.current_view` before routing the new trigger. It
//! unconditionally clears `self.opened_from_main_menu`, resolves the
//! canonical registry entry, and routes via the pure planner + the
//! `FilterableView` arms pinned by
//! `trigger_builtin_repeat_idempotency_contract.rs`.
//!
//! **Refactor threat** — a contributor, surprised that
//! `triggerBuiltin X` clobbers an already-active non-main view
//! (e.g. after reading Pass #12's receipt-only observation before
//! Pass #13's retraction), could add a guard at the top of
//! `dispatch_trigger_builtin_name`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if !matches!(self.current_view, AppView::ScriptList) {
//!     return None;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! or equivalent inside `apply_trigger_builtin`. That change would
//! turn the observed compose-in-place behavior into a silent no-op,
//! breaking the Pass #16 A30 receipt and the automation flows that
//! rely on quick view-to-view jumps without an intervening `escape`.
//! This contract catches that edit at test time.
//!
//! Complements but does NOT overlap with the Run 2 Pass #55 contract
//! `trigger_builtin_repeat_idempotency_contract.rs`, which pins the
//! per-view assignment arms inside `show_filterable_view` (pure
//! struct-literal overwrites, no conditional wrappers). This one pins
//! the UMBRELLA functions one level up.
