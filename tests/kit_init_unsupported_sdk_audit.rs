//! Repo-boundary lint: shipped `kit-init/` guidance cannot silently call
//! SDK APIs that `kit://sdk-reference` still marks `Unsupported`. The
//! canonical list of unsupported APIs lives in
//! [`script_kit_gpui::mcp_resources::sdk_reference_entries_for_ui`];
//! this guard reads from there so it stays in lockstep as entries flip
//! between Supported / Unsupported without any manual test edits.
//!
//! History: the guard originally targeted `notify(...)` while `notify` was
//! flagged Unsupported. Once `notify` was implemented on top of
//! `notify-rust`, it was dropped from the Unsupported list and the guard
//! automatically retargeted at whatever remained (currently `menu`).
//!
//! Failure mode: any runnable line (code fence, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`,
//! `.jsx`, or `.md`) in `kit-init/` that calls `name(...)` for any
//! currently-Unsupported SDK entry fails with a file + line number the
//! author can jump to. API-reference prose that merely names the function
//! inside a markdown table cell is tolerated — the test only flags the
//! presence of `name(` which implies a call-site.
