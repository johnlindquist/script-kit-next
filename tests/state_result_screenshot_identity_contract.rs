//! Source-level contract for `tool-state-image-identity` (Run 5 Pass #1).
//!
//! The `screenshot-identity-threading` user story wanted a live receipt
//! of `getState.imageIdentity="screenshot:<timestamp>"` after a tab-ai
//! capture, so automation could verify identity threading from capture
//! through to ACP context without grepping the filesystem. Pass #14 of
//! Run 1 discovered three structural gaps; the remaining one —
//! "`imageIdentity` is not a `State` field" — is closed here by adding
//! `screenshotIdentity: Option<String>` to the `stateResult` JSON.
//!
//! The field carries the BARE filename of the most recent tab-ai
//! screenshot captured in this process lifetime (`None` if no capture
//! has happened). Identity is already encoded in that filename via
//! `build_tab_ai_screenshot_filename` (timestamp + PID + sequence), so
//! reading `getState.screenshotIdentity` gives automation the same
//! identity the ACP context line `screenshot path: <path>` carries —
//! just without the leading directory and without a filesystem read.
//!
//! Contract pinned:
//!
//! 1. `StateResult` variant declares `screenshot_identity: Option<String>`
//!    with `#[serde(rename = "screenshotIdentity", ...)]`, `default`, and
//!    `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` — so the key is simply
//!    absent when no capture has occurred (not `null`). Presence of a
//!    `null`-valued key would widen the protocol surface; every parser
//!    would have to handle `undefined | null | string` where `undefined
//!    | string` is enough.
//!
//! 2. `Message::state_result` constructor accepts `screenshot_identity:
//!    Option<String>` as a trailing positional parameter. Keeping it near
//!    the end of the constructor lets future
//!    refactors introduce more state-snapshot fields in the same
//!    trailing slot without reshuffling the whole signature.
//!
//! 3. The `Tab AI` capture paths call `record_last_screenshot_identity`
//!    after a successful file write. The recorded value is the BARE
//!    filename returned by `build_tab_ai_screenshot_filename`, NOT the
//!    absolute path — the automation field is an identity, not a
//!    filesystem handle. Reading through a path would require automation
//!    to know the tmp dir layout.
//!
//! 4. `current_screenshot_identity()` is the single public read
//!    accessor. The prompt-handler state snapshot wires through this
//!    accessor — reshuffling the static's Mutex/OnceLock wrapper
//!    without routing reads through the accessor would break the
//!    snapshot silently.
