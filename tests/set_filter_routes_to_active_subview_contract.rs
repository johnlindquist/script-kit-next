//! Source-level contract for the Run 2 Pass #34
//! `tool-setfilter-active-view-routing` user story.
//!
//! Pass #14 recorded sub-gap (2) of `empty-clipboard-state`: the
//! `SetFilter` stdin command's receiver — `set_filter_text_immediate`
//! in `src/app_impl/filter_input_updates.rs` — updated only
//! `self.filter_text` + the main-menu ranker path, never writing the
//! text into the active subview's variant `filter` field. The
//! user-facing consequence: stdin-driven `setFilter "xyz"` on
//! `ClipboardHistoryView` / `EmojiPickerView` / `AppLauncherView` /
//! `WindowSwitcherView` (and siblings) silently left the subview's
//! filter stale, so `getState.visibleChoiceCount` — computed in
//! `prompt_handler/mod.rs` from the *variant's* `filter` field
//! (see the `ClipboardHistoryView` arm around line 2120) — could
//! never drop to zero on a filter-miss, making the `empty-clipboard-state`
//! story's corrected acceptance clause (Pass #33's `visibleChoiceCount=0`)
//! structurally unreachable even after Pass #33 pinned the protocol field.
//!
//! The complementary path — UI text-change events via
//! `handle_filter_input_change` — already routes correctly through
//! per-variant match arms that call `sync_builtin_query_state` on the
//! subview's `filter` + `selected_index`. The asymmetry between the two
//! entry points is exactly what sub-gap (2) documented.
//!
//! Pass #34 fixes this by introducing
//! `ScriptListApp::write_filter_to_current_subview(&mut self, text: &str) -> bool`
//! and wiring it into `set_filter_text_immediate` so stdin-driven filter
//! writes land on the active subview's own field. A return of `true`
//! also suppresses the ScriptList-only fallback-mode branch, since
//! `get_filtered_results_cached` and `collect_fallbacks` both key on
//! the script list and would incorrectly flip a subview into fallback
//! rendering.
//!
//! This contract test pins the invariants at source level so a future
//! mechanical refactor cannot silently regress the routing or erase
//! the fallback-mode gate.
