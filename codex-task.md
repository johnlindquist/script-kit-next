# Task: Fix Confirmation Dialog Light Theme and Centering

## Problem
Looking at the screenshot, the confirmation dialog has two issues:
1. **Light theme styling** - The dialog appears to have light theme styling issues that need to be fixed
2. **Centering** - The confirmation dialog ("Are you sure you want to Test Confirmation?") needs to be properly centered in the window

## Requirements
1. Find the confirmation dialog implementation in the codebase
2. Fix the light theme styling so it looks correct
3. Ensure the dialog is properly centered within the main window
4. The dialog should have proper contrast and visibility in light theme

## Context
This is a Script Kit GPUI app built in Rust using the GPUI framework. The confirmation dialog appears as a modal overlay when certain actions require user confirmation.
