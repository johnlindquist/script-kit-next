# Session: Add mouse click support and scroll-to-top consistency in built-in views

## Files changed
- `src/app_impl.rs` — Added `scroll_to_item(0, Top)` on filter change for AppLauncher, WindowSwitcher, ThemeChooser
- `src/render_builtins.rs` — Added click-to-select and double-click-to-execute handlers for ClipboardHistory, AppLauncher, WindowSwitcher, FileSearch

## What was improved

### Click-to-select in built-in views
Previously, built-in list views (ClipboardHistory, AppLauncher, WindowSwitcher,
FileSearch) had keyboard-only navigation. The main menu (ScriptList) supported
click-to-select and double-click-to-execute, but built-in views did not.
Now all four views support single-click to select an item and double-click
to execute the primary action (paste, launch, focus window, open file).

Uses the same `entity_handle.downgrade()` + `upgrade()` pattern already
established in ThemeChooser. Each item gets `.cursor_pointer()` and
`.on_click(click_handler)`.

### Double-click actions per view
- ClipboardHistory: copies entry to clipboard, hides window, simulates paste
- AppLauncher: launches selected app, hides window
- WindowSwitcher: focuses selected window, hides window
- FileSearch: opens file with default app, closes window

### Scroll-to-top on filter change
AppLauncher, WindowSwitcher, and ThemeChooser were missing
`scroll_to_item(0, ScrollStrategy::Top)` in `handle_filter_input_change`.
ClipboardHistory and DesignGallery already had it. Now all views scroll
to the top when the filter text changes, preventing the list from staying
scrolled to a stale position while the content changes underneath.

## What to avoid repeating
- When adding new built-in views with uniform_list, always add:
  1. `let click_entity_handle = cx.entity().downgrade();` before the list
  2. Per-item click handler using `click_entity_handle.clone()` + `.upgrade()`
  3. `.cursor_pointer().on_click(click_handler)` on the item div
  4. `scroll_to_item(0, ScrollStrategy::Top)` in `handle_filter_input_change`
- ThemeChooser already had click support (it was the reference pattern).
  DesignGallery was skipped (read-only developer tool with complex multi-type items).
