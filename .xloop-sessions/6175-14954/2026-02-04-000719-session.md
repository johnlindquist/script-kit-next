# Session: Improve Notes Window UX (Round 2)

**Commit:** f5bcd1b
**File changed:** `src/notes/window.rs` (+183 / -4 lines)

## Changes

1. **Action feedback system** — Added `action_feedback` field with 2-second auto-clearing flash messages in the footer. Shows context-sensitive feedback: "Deleted · ⌘⇧T trash" after delete, "● Pinned"/"Unpinned" after pin toggle, "Duplicated" after duplicate, "Copied" after copy-as-markdown.
2. **Welcome note on first launch** — When no notes exist and trash is empty, creates a pre-populated tutorial note with markdown formatting examples (bold, italic, code, strikethrough, lists, checklists) and key shortcuts (⌘N, ⌘P, ⌘K, ⌘., ⌘/).
3. **Tab/Shift+Tab indentation** — Tab inserts 2 spaces at cursor; Shift+Tab removes up to 2 leading spaces from the current line. Essential for markdown list nesting and code blocks.
4. **Cmd+F vs Cmd+Shift+F split** — Cmd+F now dispatches the `Search` action to the Input component (in-editor find). Cmd+Shift+F opens the cross-notes search bar (FTS search across all notes).
5. **Created date in footer** — Shows "Jan 15, 2025" style date on hover, positioned before the relative time in the footer's right section. Uses `opacity(0.35)` to stay subtle.
6. **Updated shortcuts help** — Added Tab/⇧Tab entries under Text section and ⌘⇧F entry under View section.

## Avoid repeating

- Pre-existing test compilation errors in `dialog_builtin_action_validation_tests_2.rs` block `cargo test` but are unrelated to notes. Use `cargo test --lib notes::model` to run notes-specific tests.
- `copy_as_markdown` was `&self` — changed to `&mut self` to allow calling `show_action_feedback`. Changing method signatures is fine when the only callers are within the same struct.
- `cargo fmt` must run before committing — pre-commit hook checks formatting.
