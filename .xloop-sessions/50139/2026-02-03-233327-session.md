# Session: Improve scripts/scriptlets list UX

## Files Changed
- `src/designs/mod.rs` — List item rendering: show descriptions, script badges, tool-specific scriptlet icons
- `src/app_render.rs` — Preview panel: add extension, author, and tags badges for scripts; use `tool_display_name()` helper for scriptlets
- `src/scripts/types.rs` — Add `Scriptlet::tool_display_name()` helper method

## What Was Improved
1. **Descriptions now visible in list items** — Previously extracted but discarded (`_description`); now passed to `ListItem::description_opt()`
2. **Script shortcut/alias badges** — Scripts had no badge in list view (hardcoded `None`); now show shortcut or alias via fallback chain
3. **Tool-specific scriptlet icons** — All scriptlets used `BoltFilled`; now shell→Terminal, paste→Copy, open→PlayFilled, rest→BoltFilled
4. **Extension badge in script preview** — Shows "TypeScript", "JavaScript", "Shell", etc. based on file extension
5. **Author badge in script preview** — Shows "by {author}" from `typed_metadata.author`
6. **Tags badges in script preview** — Shows each tag from `typed_metadata.tags` as a neutral badge
7. **Deduplicated tool name mapping** — Extracted `Scriptlet::tool_display_name()` to replace inline match in `app_render.rs`

## What to Avoid Repeating
- `src/ai/window.rs` had pre-existing compile errors from another session that kept reappearing (file was being modified by an external process); had to repeatedly `git checkout` it
- `--all-targets` clippy/test won't pass due to pre-existing errors in `dialog_random_action_window_tests.rs` and `ai/window.rs`; use `--lib` for validation
- The Scriptlet struct lacks `typed_metadata` so author/tags can't be shown in scriptlet preview without a larger refactor
