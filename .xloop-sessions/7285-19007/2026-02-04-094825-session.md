# Session: Polish main menu list design

## Commit
55c47d0 `[xloop] fix: polish main menu list contrast, spacing, and visual hierarchy`

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` — all changes in one file

## What was improved
- Description text contrast: switched from text_muted@87% to text_secondary@70% for stronger readability
- Name-to-description gap: 2px → 3px for breathing room
- Section header bg tint: 6% → 8% opacity for clearer grouping
- Section header separator: 22% → 28% opacity for visible section breaks
- Item separator lines: 10% → 14% opacity for better scanability
- Selection background: 12%/18% → 14%/20% (dark/light) for clearer focus
- Icon opacity: 80% → 85% for non-selected items
- Source hint opacity: 50% → 60% for readable search context
- Tool badge opacity: 56% → 65% for legible badges

## Approach
1. Took baseline screenshots of 5 states (initial, selected, scrolled, search "set", search "open")
2. Made targeted opacity/spacing tweaks in list_item.rs
3. Rebuilt and captured verification screenshots
4. Visually compared before/after to confirm improvements
5. Ran cargo check + clippy (lib/bins) + cargo test — all pass

## What to avoid repeating
- Don't change description color to pure text_secondary (too bright) — use opacity-reduced variant
- Pre-existing clippy errors in test files (dialog_builtin_action_validation_tests_37.rs) are unrelated; use `--lib --bins` for clean check
- The `text_muted << 8 | 0xXX` pattern is the standard way to apply alpha in this codebase
