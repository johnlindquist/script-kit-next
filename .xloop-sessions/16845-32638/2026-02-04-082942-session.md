# Session: Main Menu Design Polish

## Files Changed
- `src/list_item.rs` - Section headers, item separators, section separators
- `src/render_script_list.rs` - Header divider opacity
- `src/theme/types.rs` - Light mode opacity defaults, text.dimmed color

## What Was Improved
- Section header text contrast: switched from `text_dimmed` (0xaaaaaa) to `text_muted` (0x808080) for light mode readability
- Section headers now have 4% background tint for visual grouping
- Section separator borders increased from 9% to 19% opacity
- Item separator lines increased from 5% to 8% opacity
- Header-to-list divider increased from 37% to 50% opacity
- Light mode selected item opacity: 0.12 -> 0.18 (matches design system's `from_design_with_dark_mode`)
- Light mode hover opacity: 0.08 -> 0.10
- Light mode `text.dimmed`: 0xaaaaaa -> 0x999999

## Visual Testing
- Captured baseline screenshots before changes
- Captured verification screenshots after changes
- Used named-pipe pattern with captureWindow stdin command
- Window auto-hides ~1.5s after show; must capture quickly (0.4s sleep)

## What to Avoid Repeating
- The window auto-hides on focus loss; always send captureWindow within 0.5s of show
- Pre-existing clippy warnings in test files (47 errors in `*_tests_*.rs`) are not related to changes
- `cargo fmt` alignment differs from manual alignment of struct field comments; always run fmt before commit
- Light mode opacity values in `BackgroundOpacity::light_default()` were inconsistent with `ListItemColors::from_design_with_dark_mode()` (0.12 vs 0.18 for selected); now aligned
