# Session: Main Menu Design Polish (Round 2)

## Files Changed
- `src/list_item.rs` - Selected item font weight, name-description gap, section header gap
- `src/components/prompt_footer.rs` - Footer background color, shadow, border opacity
- `src/app_render.rs` - Preview panel labels (weight, opacity, spacing), dividers

## What Was Improved
- Selected item name: MEDIUM -> SEMIBOLD for visual emphasis
- Search match highlights: SEMIBOLD -> BOLD for stronger contrast against muted base
- Name-description gap: added 1px gap for breathing room between lines
- Section header icon gap: 5px -> 6px for readability
- Footer light-mode bg: 0xeceaec (pink-tinted) -> 0xf0eeef (neutral warm gray)
- Footer shadow: 5% -> 8% opacity, 4px -> 6px blur for better separation
- Footer border opacity: 0x60 -> 0x50 in light mode (subtler)
- Preview panel labels: added FontWeight::MEDIUM + 80% opacity (0xCC) for hierarchy
- Preview label spacing: padding_xs/2 -> padding_xs for consistency
- Preview dividers: 37% -> 25% opacity, spacing sm -> md for breathing room
- Applied consistently across all preview types (Script, Scriptlet, BuiltIn, App)

## Visual Testing
- Captured baseline and after screenshots using named-pipe stdin protocol
- Used `captureWindow` with 0.4s delay after `show` (window auto-hides ~1.5s)
- Verified improvements to text hierarchy and footer appearance

## What to Avoid Repeating
- Pre-existing clippy warnings (47 errors) in `*_tests_*.rs` files are not related to changes
- `cargo fmt` alignment of inline comments differs from manual alignment; always run fmt before commit
- Window auto-hides on focus loss; send captureWindow within 0.5s of show
- The `replace_all` parameter is needed when the same pattern appears in multiple preview types (Script, Scriptlet, BuiltIn, App)
- Footer background 0xeceaec had a slight pink tint that was noticeable on neutral backgrounds
