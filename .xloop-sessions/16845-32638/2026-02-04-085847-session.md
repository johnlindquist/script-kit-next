# Session: Main Menu Design Polish (Round 3) - Contrast & Label Hierarchy

## Files Changed
- `src/app_render.rs` - Preview panel labels across all result types (Script, Scriptlet, BuiltIn, App, Window, Agent, Fallback)
- `src/list_item.rs` - Section header count badge opacity, header background tint
- `src/render_script_list.rs` - Header position indicator and library size hint opacity

## What Was Improved
- Preview panel labels: converted all to UPPERCASE for clear visual hierarchy (e.g., "Description" → "DESCRIPTION", "Keywords" → "KEYWORDS", "Feature Type" → "FEATURE TYPE")
- Preview label opacity: 0xCC (80%) → 0xDD (87%) for better readability against vibrancy backgrounds
- Consistent label styling: standardized all preview labels across all result types to use FontWeight::MEDIUM + 87% opacity + UPPERCASE (previously Window/Agent/Fallback types used inconsistent styling without font_weight)
- Section header count badge: 0xB0 (69%) → 0xCC (80%) opacity for better visibility
- Section header background tint: 0x0A (~4%) → 0x0D (~5%) for slightly stronger grouping
- Header library size hint: 0x80 (50%) → 0x9F (62%) opacity for better readability
- Header position indicator (e.g., "3 / 45"): 0xB0 (69%) → 0xCC (80%) opacity

## Visual Testing
- Captured baseline screenshots before changes (main menu, selection, filtered)
- Captured after screenshots to verify improvements
- Used named-pipe pattern with captureWindow stdin command
- Window auto-hides ~1.5s after show; captured within 0.4s

## What to Avoid Repeating
- Pre-existing clippy errors in `*_tests_*.rs` files (unused imports, unused functions, manual Range::contains) are NOT related to changes
- `src/main.rs` and `src/render_builtins.rs` had pre-existing unstaged changes; only commit files actually modified in the session
- The preview labels had inconsistent styling patterns: most used `font_weight(MEDIUM) + rgba + 0xCC`, but App/Window/Agent/Fallback "Type" labels used `rgb(text_muted)` without font_weight - now all standardized
- `replace_all` works well for updating the common label pattern, but the App/Window/Agent/Fallback type indicators use different indentation and must be updated individually
