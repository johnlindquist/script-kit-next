# Session: Polish main menu list design

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` - Typography, separators, selection/hover opacity, section headers
- `src/theme/types.rs` - Light mode selection/hover opacity defaults

## What was improved
- Description text: 11.5px -> 12px (minimum readability per typography guidelines)
- Description line-height: 15px -> 16px (1.33x ratio)
- Name line-height: 18px -> 20px (1.43x ratio for 14px, per Inter/Material guidelines)
- Item separators: 14% -> 8% opacity (softer, content-first approach)
- Section header border: 28% -> 18% opacity (less aggressive)
- Section header bg: 8% -> 5% opacity (lighter, lets vibrancy through)
- Selection opacity: dark 14%->12%, light 18%->16% (aligned with Material Design ~4-6dp elevation)
- Hover opacity: dark 8%->6%, light 10%->9% (subtler feedback)

## Research basis
- Material Design dark theme elevation overlay model
- Raycast/Alfred launcher UI patterns
- Inter font typography guidelines (line-height ratios)
- WCAG contrast ratio requirements

## What to avoid repeating
- Pre-existing clippy warnings in test files (`--all-targets`) are not from this change
- The Default design reads opacity from theme (`from_theme()`), not from `from_design_with_dark_mode()` - update both paths when changing opacity
- Screenshots require named pipe pattern with proper sleep timings (3s startup, 1.5s show, 1.5s capture)
