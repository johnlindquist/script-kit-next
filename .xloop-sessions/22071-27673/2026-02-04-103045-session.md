# Session: Polish main menu list - contrast, spacing, vibrancy readability

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` - Description opacity, search description base color, name-description gap, section header text/bg/border, light mode selection/hover opacity in design path
- `src/theme/types.rs` - Light mode selection/hover opacity defaults

## What was improved
- Description text: 70% → 80% opacity of text_secondary for better readability on vibrancy backgrounds
- Search description base: text_dimmed at 80% → text_secondary at 70% - significantly improved legibility of search result descriptions
- Name-description gap: 3px → 2px for tighter visual pairing (per typography research)
- Light mode selection opacity: 16% → 20% for visible highlight on light vibrancy
- Light mode hover opacity: 9% → 12% for visible feedback on light vibrancy
- Section header text: text_muted (rgb) → text_secondary at 85% opacity for readability
- Section header icon: text_muted at 75% → text_secondary at 70% for subordination
- Section header count badge: text_muted at 80% → text_secondary at 60% for hierarchy
- Section header bg tint: 5% → 4% for subtler grouping
- Section separator border: 18% → 15% opacity for less dominance

## Research basis
- Apple semantic label colors (primary 100%, secondary 60%, tertiary 30%)
- Material Design dark theme text opacity model (87%/60%/38%)
- Raycast launcher design patterns (compact spacing, strong text hierarchy)
- WCAG contrast requirements (4.5:1 AA, 3:1 for large text)
- macOS vibrancy design guidelines (avoid pure white text, use opacity for hierarchy)

## What to avoid repeating
- Pre-existing clippy warnings in test files (`--all-targets`) are not from this change - use `--lib --bin` for verification
- Both `from_theme()` and `from_design_with_dark_mode()` paths need updating when changing opacity defaults
- Section header colors used text_muted across 5 locations (text, icon, count, bg, border) - update all for consistency
- Light mode vibrancy washes out low-opacity elements more than dark mode - always test in light mode
- Named pipe visual test pattern: 3s startup, 1.5s show, 0.3s per key, 1s per capture
