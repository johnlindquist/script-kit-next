# Session: Deepen visual hierarchy for calmer list

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` — all changes in one file

## What was improved
- Non-selected item name opacity reduced from 85% to 72% (new ALPHA_NAME_QUIET constant)
- Non-selected icon opacity reduced from 70% to 50% (new ALPHA_ICON_QUIET constant)
- Selected item name weight changed from SEMIBOLD to MEDIUM (eliminates text reflow jank on arrow-key navigation)
- Section header text weight reduced from MEDIUM to NORMAL
- Section header text opacity reduced from 70% to 50%
- Section header icon opacity reduced from 65% to 35%
- Section header count badge opacity reduced from 70% to 35%
- Section separator opacity reduced from 14% to 8%

## Design rationale
Research across Raycast, Spotlight, Linear, VS Code, and cmdk reference implementations shows the consensus: launchers indicate selection via background fill + color shift, not font weight changes. None of the reference implementations change font weight on selection — it causes text reflow micro-jank during keyboard navigation. Non-selected items should be calm (~70% opacity), icons even calmer (~50%), and section headers should "whisper" (orientation-only, not attention-grabbers). The goal: selected item stands out through contrast with its dimmed surroundings, not through its own visual heaviness.

## What to avoid repeating
- ALPHA_STRONG (85%) is shared between non-selected name opacity and selected description opacity. Created purpose-specific ALPHA_NAME_QUIET instead of modifying the shared constant.
- ALPHA_HINT (70%) was used for both icons and section headers. Created ALPHA_ICON_QUIET (50%) for icons only; reused it for section header text which wanted the same target.
- Section header icons and count badges use ALPHA_DESC_QUIET (35%) — same as non-selected description text — for consistent "quiet" treatment.
- Pre-existing clippy errors in test files and ai/window.rs are unrelated to list_item.rs changes.
- The captureWindow stdin command requires a window title match, not an empty string — use macOS `screencapture` as fallback for screenshots.
