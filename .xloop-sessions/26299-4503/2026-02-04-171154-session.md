# Session: Declutter main window list

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` — all changes in one file

## What was improved
- Removed separator lines between list items (border_b_1 + border_color)
- Reduced description opacity from 75% to 35% for non-selected items (new ALPHA_DESC_QUIET constant)
- Changed name font weight from MEDIUM to NORMAL for non-selected items
- Added 85% opacity to non-selected item names (was full primary)
- Reduced icon opacity from 85% to 70% for non-selected items
- Removed section header background tint
- Reduced section header text opacity from 85% to 70%
- Changed section header font weight from SEMIBOLD to MEDIUM
- Reduced section header icon opacity from 75% to 65%
- Softened section separator border from 22% to 14%
- Prefixed unused ALPHA_SEPARATOR_STRONG with underscore

## Design rationale
The list felt "busy and intimidating" because every element competed for attention equally. The fix creates a clear visual hierarchy: the selected item is prominent while unselected items recede. Descriptions become visible-but-quiet background info rather than mandatory reading for every row.

## What to avoid repeating
- ALPHA_MUTED is shared across description, header icon, and tool badge. Don't change it directly — create a purpose-specific constant (ALPHA_DESC_QUIET) instead.
- The light-mode vibrancy background makes opacity changes less dramatic than expected. 35% on light bg is still quite readable.
- Pre-existing clippy errors in ai/window.rs and test files are unrelated to list_item.rs changes.
