# Session: Improve scripts/scriptlets UX

## Files Changed
- `src/designs/mod.rs` — auto-generate descriptions for scriptlets, alias/keyword hints in grouped view
- `src/scripts/search.rs` — nucleo fuzzy matching for description fields in script + scriptlet search

## What Was Improved

### 1. Auto-generated descriptions for scriptlets
Scriptlets without explicit descriptions now show their tool type as a fallback description (e.g., "Shell", "TypeScript", "Paste", "Open URL"). Uses the existing `tool_display_name()` method. This helps users scan the list and understand what each scriptlet does.

### 2. Better description fuzzy search
Added nucleo-based fuzzy matching for description fields in both `fuzzy_search_scripts()` and `fuzzy_search_scriptlets()`. Previously descriptions only got a +25 bonus for exact substring matches. Now they also get nucleo fuzzy scoring (+15 base + scaled score), catching typos and partial matches when searching by what a script does.

### 3. Alias/keyword discovery hints in grouped view
When a script/scriptlet has both a shortcut (shown as the right-side badge) AND an alias/keyword (hidden), the hidden trigger is now shown as a subtle source hint (e.g., "/gc") in the accessories area. This helps users discover trigger mechanisms they might not know about.

## What to Avoid Repeating
- `git stash` + `git stash pop` can fail when other dirty files conflict — better to just verify without stashing
- Pre-existing build errors in `ai/window.rs` and `render_builtins.rs` on main — don't waste time investigating those
- The pre-commit hook checks ALL files' formatting, not just staged files — run `cargo fmt` before committing
