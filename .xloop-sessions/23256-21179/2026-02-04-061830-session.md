# Session: Add property indicators, tag hints, author context, and property keyword search

## Files Changed
- `src/designs/mod.rs` — property badges for scripts, tags in grouped view, author in search hints
- `src/scripts/search.rs` — property keyword search + 7 new tests

## What Was Improved

### 1. Script property indicators in list items
Scripts with special runtime behavior now show a small badge in the list:
- `cron` badge for scripts with cron/schedule metadata
- `watch` badge for scripts watching file patterns
- `bg` badge for background scripts
- `sys` badge for system scripts
Priority order: cron > watch > bg > sys (shows most important).

### 2. Tags shown in grouped view
In the grouped (no-search) view, scripts with tags now show up to 2 tags as a subtle source hint (e.g., "productivity · notes"). Only shown when the script doesn't already have an alias hint displayed.

### 3. Author in search result source hints
During search mode, if a script has an author, it appears in the source hint alongside kit name and file extension (e.g., "cleanshot · .ts · by John"). Uses the existing parts-join pattern.

### 4. Property keyword search
Users can now find scripts by their runtime properties:
- Typing "cron" or "scheduled" finds scripts with cron/schedule metadata
- Typing "background" or "bg" finds background scripts
- Typing "system" finds system scripts
- Typing "watch" or "watching" finds scripts with file watch patterns
Uses `contains_ignore_ascii_case` on the query to check if property keywords appear, then applies +35 score bonus.

### 5. Tests
Added 7 new tests:
- `test_property_search_finds_cron_scripts` — cron keyword matches cron scripts
- `test_property_search_scheduled_synonym` — "scheduled" synonym works
- `test_property_search_finds_background_scripts` — background keyword works
- `test_property_search_finds_watch_scripts` — watch keyword works
- `test_property_search_finds_system_scripts` — system keyword works
- `test_property_search_no_false_positives` — plain scripts don't match property keywords

## What to Avoid Repeating
- Pre-existing build errors in `ai/window.rs` on main — use `cargo check --lib`, `cargo clippy --lib`, `cargo test --lib` to bypass bin-only errors
- Other agents may lock files via `.claude-locks/` — skip locked files
- `cargo fmt` may fail if another agent has syntax errors in any file
- Section header icons in `grouping.rs` already exist (StarFilled, Code, Terminal, BoltFilled, Folder) — no need to add them again
