# Session: AI Chat Window Design Polish

## Files Changed
- `src/ai/window.rs` — all changes in this file

## What Was Improved
- **Message contrast**: User bg 0.10→0.13 accent, assistant bg 0.30→0.18 muted. Left border 0.3→0.4 opacity.
- **Role labels**: SEMIBOLD→BOLD, added dot separator between label and timestamp. Assistant label dimmed to 0.8 opacity.
- **Message spacing**: Non-continuation 12px→16px gap, continuation 4px→6px. Role label row margin 4px→6px.
- **Message bubble padding**: p_3 → px(14)/py(12), rounded_lg → rounded(8px). Consistent across messages and streaming.
- **Input area**: Added border-top separator (border.opacity(0.5)). Padding: px(10)/pt(10)/pb(6)/gap(6).
- **Sidebar**: Date group headings MEDIUM→SEMIBOLD at 0.6 opacity, pt(6)/pb(4) spacing.
- **Welcome screen**: Heading SEMIBOLD→BOLD, suggestion cards 0.4→0.25 / hover 0.7→0.45.
- **Title bar**: Added MEDIUM weight, muted_foreground→0.7 opacity.
- **Message actions**: mt(-4)→mt(2), mb_2→mb(4) for better spacing.
- **Streaming content**: bg 0.3→0.18 muted, matching assistant message style.

## Visual Testing
- Baseline screenshot captured before changes
- Post-polish screenshot verified improvements
- Named pipe protocol with captureWindow used for screenshots

## What to Avoid Repeating
- Window capture needs 5s+ delay after openAiWithMockData for window to be visible
- Empty title "" in captureWindow fails — use "Script Kit" to match
- Pre-existing clippy warnings in test files (47 errors) are not caused by this change
