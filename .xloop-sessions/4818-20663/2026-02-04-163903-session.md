# Session: Polish main window list item brightness and metadata readability

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` — 4 targeted opacity/color changes

## What was improved
- **Non-selected item names**: `text_secondary` → `text_primary` — names are now the primary scan target at full brightness; selection is differentiated by bg tint, accent bar, and font weight (SEMIBOLD vs MEDIUM)
- **Non-selected icons**: `text_secondary` base → `text_primary` base at 85% — slightly brighter icons improve visual recognition without competing with names
- **Section header count**: `ALPHA_SUBTLE` (65%) → `ALPHA_HINT` (70%) — count badges like "8" in "SUGGESTED 8" are more readable
- **Tool badge text**: `ALPHA_MUTED` (75%) → `ALPHA_READABLE` (80%) — scriptlet badges ("ts", "bash", "paste") are more legible in search results

## Verified states
- Default list view (no filter) — brighter names, clear selection
- Search/filter with highlight characters ("dark") — highlights still pop, non-highlighted base text unaffected (uses its own StyledText color)
- Section headers (SUGGESTED, COMMANDS) — count badges more readable
- Selected item accent bar + background — still clearly differentiated
- Type tag pills (Command, Snippet, Fallback) — unaffected
- Tool badges in search results — slightly more readable

## What to avoid repeating
- Pre-existing clippy error in `ai/window.rs:5729` (collapsed if) — not related to list_item changes; use `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (lib only) and filter for your file
- `captureWindow` title param must be `""` (empty string) to match main window
- The highlighted name rendering (StyledText) sets its own text_color, so changes to the parent div's text_color don't affect search highlight appearance
- Non-selected names now use text_primary; if more differentiation is ever needed, add a new `ALPHA_NAME_UNSELECTED` constant rather than reverting to text_secondary
