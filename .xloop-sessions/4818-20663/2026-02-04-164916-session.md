# Session: Boost selected item description contrast and unify preview panel labels

## Files changed
- `src/list_item.rs` — 2 targeted opacity changes (selected description boost)
- `src/app_render.rs` — 8 label style unifications (App/Window/Agent/Fallback preview)

## What was improved
- **Selected item description opacity**: ALPHA_MUTED (75%) → ALPHA_STRONG (85%) when selected — description text is now more readable against the blue selection background tint
- **Selected highlighted description base**: Same 75% → 85% boost for description text when search highlighting is active on a selected item
- **Preview panel label consistency**: App, Window, Agent, and Fallback preview labels unified from `text_xs()`/`MEDIUM`/`0xDD` (10px, medium, 87%) to `text_size(px(11.0))`/`SEMIBOLD`/`0xCC` (11px, semibold, 80%) — now matches Script, Scriptlet, and BuiltIn label styling

## Verified states
- Default list view (no filter) — selected description brighter, non-selected unchanged
- Search/filter with highlight characters ("dark") — selected description boost visible
- Section headers (SUGGESTED, COMMANDS) — unaffected
- Preview panel labels (DESCRIPTION, KEYWORDS, FEATURE TYPE) — consistent across all result types
- Type tag pills (Command, Snippet, Fallback) — unaffected

## What to avoid repeating
- Pre-existing clippy error in `ai/window.rs:5729` (collapsed if) — use `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (lib only) and filter for your file
- `captureWindow` title param must be `""` (empty string) to match main window
- Bash named pipe requires `exec 3>"$PIPE"` pattern to keep fd open for multiple writes; separate `echo > $PIPE` calls risk race conditions
- The `$!` expansion fails in some bash contexts within the Bash tool; use `bash -c '...'` wrapper for reliable PID capture
- Non-selected description opacity remains at ALPHA_MUTED (75%); only selected items get the ALPHA_STRONG (85%) boost
- Preview panel labels for Window/Agent types previously used different styling (text_xs, MEDIUM, 0xDD) — all are now unified to the Script/BuiltIn pattern (11px, SEMIBOLD, 0xCC)
