//! Oracle-Session `protocol-builtin-boundary-refactor-plan` PR3:
//! pure resolver for `triggerBuiltin` stdin bodies.
//!
//! The stdin dispatcher previously interleaved name-normalization,
//! alias lookup, `builtinId` lookup, logging, and dispatch in one
//! function. That made it impossible to test the routing decisions
//! without spinning a whole app. This module extracts the pure
//! `JSON body -> TriggerBuiltinResolution` function. It takes a
//! `&serde_json::Value`, reads the two recognized keys (`name`,
//! `builtinId`), and returns a structured outcome.
//!
//! No logging, no side effects, no global state. The dispatcher
//! layer turns the outcome into user-visible feedback; golden-file
//! tests at `tests/trigger_builtin_resolve_golden.rs` pin the
//! resolver's decisions against a small JSONL transcript so the
//! routing table can be audited without a real window.
