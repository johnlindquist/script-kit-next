//! Platform-specific window configuration abstraction.
//!
//! This module provides cross-platform abstractions for window behavior configuration,
//! with macOS-specific implementations for floating panel behavior and space management.
//!
//! # macOS Behavior
//!
//! On macOS, this module configures windows as floating panels that:
//! - Float above normal windows (NSFloatingWindowLevel = 3)
//! - Move to the active space when shown (NSWindowCollectionBehaviorMoveToActiveSpace = 2)
//! - Disable window state restoration to prevent position caching
//!
//! # Other Platforms
//!
//! On non-macOS platforms, these functions are no-ops, allowing cross-platform code
//! to call them without conditional compilation at the call site.
