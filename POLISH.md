# The Polish Bar

**Status:** Draft for John's calibration · Authored 2026-07-06
**Companion:** [`.impeccable.md`](.impeccable.md) defines the *taste* (what it should look like). This doc defines the *bar* (measurable budgets, contracts, and how each is proven). A violation of this doc is a **bug**, not a preference — triage it like a crash.

Every statement below was reverse-engineered from evidence: 7,726 commits of git history, plus John's own words mined from ~3,400 Claude Code sessions and ~6,000 Codex sessions (2026-03 → 2026-07). Receipts are cited as commit hashes or dated quotes. Numbers marked **(proposed)** are inferred, not evidenced — calibrate them; everything else was already enforced at least once.

How agents use this doc:

1. **Triage:** any observed violation of a bar below is at least P1 polish debt. Rank findings against these dimensions, in this order — the ordering reflects how often John complains about each.
2. **Fix classes, not instances:** every fix must land one rung up the CLAUDE.md enforcement ladder (compiler → lint → behavior test → devtools probe → source audit). A patched pixel without a lock will regress.
3. **Prove it in the real UI:** a fix must change what renders, not what a test greps — "no fake-green" (`d67df7cb4`).

## 1. Latency — "Instant" is the product

The single most repeated word in three years of sessions. The window is a reflex, not an app.

**The bar:**

- Every keystroke in any filter input paints its result inside the **16ms frame budget**. Evidenced and enforced: worst-case typing latency driven 187ms → 14ms, "All inputs now under 18ms (within 16ms frame budget)" (`13a417737`). Applies to held keys too: "definite 'hiccups' when holding down delete… feel laggy" (2026-05-20).
- **Nothing synchronous and expensive on the keystroke path.** SQLite, history search, osascript probes, browser URL sniffs run off-thread and merge next frame. Evidenced: `@` was blocking the UI thread ~943ms → 4ms (`bf0b87ffc`); ai_vault (avg 99ms) and browser_history (avg 30ms) gated behind explicit filters (`13a417737`). Budget: **≤1ms synchronous work per keystroke (proposed)**.
- **Hotkey → window visible with input focused: ≤50ms (proposed)**, and no keystroke typed immediately after the hotkey is ever dropped. Keyboard-focus readiness is a measured property (`3918ad57d`); state resets *before* the shortcut, "so that it's ready and there's no timers/guards/sense of delay" (2026-06-17).
- **Surface transitions are instant.** Main↔Agent Chat, escape-back, Tab-to-chat: "there should be no reason for any lag" (2026-04-03), "Please make it instant" (2026-05-25). Budget: **one perceived frame, ≤50ms (proposed)**.
- **Openable surfaces come pre-warmed**, never cold-spawned: warm PTY pool (`8929093e3`), Tab AI harness prewarm (`de4eb2789`), focused-text Pi prewarm (`0d5983543`).
- **No artificial delays** on interaction paths (`eb288220a`), and no full-screen loading gate when the input could be live immediately: "input is immediately available — users can start typing while context loads in background" (`f275c1eb3`).
- Arrow-key navigation updates the list in the same frame as the footer — never let chrome update before content ("the footer text changes in time, but the items list doesn't", 2026-05-08).

**Proof:** devtools latency probe measuring hotkey→visible, keystroke→paint (incl. key-repeat storm), and transition times; red/green numbers per run. Off-thread rule locked by clippy `disallowed-methods` where expressible, else behavior test.

## 2. Layout stability — nothing moves that the user didn't move

Layout shift reads to John as literally *broken*: "it causes the footer layout to shift around so the buttons don't feel 'stable'" (2026-05-21).

**The bar:**

- **The visible frame never changes under the cursor for the same input.** Late/async provider results may warm caches but must not republish rows, move selection, or shift a click target mid-typing — the query-frame latch (`910c40a07`).
- **Search results grow monotonically as you type.** "'Why is' has more/completely results than 'Why i'. It makes it feel broken" (2026-06-22). No instant-result-then-replaced-after-a-beat (2026-05-09).
- **No stale-content flash on mode entry.** Typing `/` or `@` must never flash the previous command/mention before clearing (2026-04-16, 2026-04-20 — a repeat regression; deserves a permanent probe).
- **Popups freeze their shell size once open** and scroll inside it. Actions menu resize-while-typing is a standing P1 (layout-stability audit 2026-07-04); content-sized popups are not user-resizable (`76268b2b7`).
- **No loading-skeleton flash when a synchronous first paint is cheap** — the ~59ms skeleton was replaced by a ~0.5ms sync seed (`977cee601`). Threshold: if first paint can be computed in **≤5ms (proposed)**, paint it synchronously.
- **Stable slots for stateful chrome.** Footer actions swap labels, not slots (Agent Chat audit item); reserve lanes for validation messages and status rows instead of inserting them.
- **Overflow clips the disposable end, never the data** ('100 words' must not render as '00 words', `c2b69cad0`). Widths come from real flex layout, never per-character estimates (`8af8eb31f`, `ca4c93d19`; standing flexbox mandate).
- **Footer buttons never shrink or truncate** — "or else they're useless" (2026-07-06). Shortcut buttons keep intrinsic width (`flex_none` / hug-to-content in `footer_chrome`); informational lanes absorb width pressure and may truncate instead.
- Scroll containment: inner regions scroll themselves, never the page around them (2026-06-15).

**Proof:** devtools rect-diff probe (element rects across frames during type/open/stream); golden screenshots per surface; the remaining 2026-07-04 audit backlog is the burn-down list.

## 3. Escape & dismissal — Escape is sacred

**The bar:**

- **One Escape contract for the whole app**, derived from the `DismissPolicy` table — never per-renderer booleans (`cdb65127c`).
- **Escape unwinds exactly one layer per press**; every branch stops propagation so nothing double-fires (`8900405ee`). Delete has its own ladder in cwd mode (one delete → `/`, two → main menu, 2026-05-28).
- **Destination depends on origin:** opened from the main menu → Escape returns there; opened directly (shortcut/tray/deeplink) → Escape closes the window (`4794e630c`).
- **Escape and Cmd+W have identical data-loss behavior** — Escape saves before closing (`db96a750d`). Semantics stay distinct: Escape = back, Cmd+W = close window (2026-04-02).
- **Destructive dismissal needs a two-press arm + HUD within a 2s window** (`cdb65127c`).
- **Toggles are debounced (300ms)** so close-then-reopen can't strand or double-open (`c9f2c3311`, `2da4365f0`).
- **Popups/dialogs auto-close on focus loss** (2026-03-23) and HUD messages always auto-dismiss (2026-06-11). No redundant confirmation HUDs when the outcome is visible (2026-03-26).
- Escape must never look hung: a paused-but-open dictation UI on Escape is a defect (2026-04-01).

**Proof:** `flows/escape.md` owns this dimension; every surface gets an escape-ladder behavior test; new surfaces cannot ship without a `DismissPolicy` row (compiler rung: exhaustive match, no wildcard).

## 4. Focus & keyboard — focus lands where typing goes

**The bar:**

- **The filter input owns focus by default.** Unclaimed clicks and window drags return focus to the input, never dump it on the list root (`9858f21b8`; "if you type, nothing happens" 2026-06-11).
- **Focus is restored after every popup, action, or dialog dismiss** (`82696857a`; "it doesn't refocus on the ai chat input" 2026-03-21). No pre-attach focus steal (`a6fd4e035`, `a39de7029`).
- **Every displayed shortcut fires.** A rendered keycap that doesn't work is a broken promise ("ensure that all actions with displayed shortcuts have their shortcuts enabled", 2026-06-08).
- **Modals trap the keyboard:** Tab cycles inside, Escape closes, nothing leaks to the surface behind (`225240d4c`; "each 'Tab' is sending values to the ACP Chat behind the scenes" 2026-04-28). The focused button is unmistakable — the user always knows what Enter will do (`3f42543b1`).
- **Paste is paste** — never re-typed character-by-character, never auto-submits (2026-06-19).
- Global keys are scoped: surface-level bindings (Tab, Cmd+P) must not shadow editor semantics ("I *hate* 'Tab' to open ACP Chat… inside of a markdown editor", 2026-04-09).

**Proof:** simulateGpuiEvent focus probes per surface (open → click dead space → type; open popup → dismiss → type); autofocus regressions get permanent probes — they've recurred (2026-03-13, 2026-04-16).

## 5. Consistency — one system, zero drift

John's most emotionally-loaded complaint pattern: "I feel like you're misunderstanding the concept of 'reusing components' and 'consistency'" (2026-06-08); "Some jr dev added that feature and I hate it" (2026-06-12).

**The bar:**

- **Shared render paths, not lookalikes.** Same input component in main menu, mini agent, Agent Chat; Today == Notes editor render path (`8b266e444`); ACP input == main menu layout (`2dee3c380`). A surface reimplementing shared UX locally is a defect even if pixel-identical today — drift is the failure mode.
- **Zero hardcoded visual values outside token layers.** Colors, spacing, radii, insets, opacity resolve through `crate::theme` / chrome tokens; one canonical vibrancy opacity token resolved by every window (`f4cca5f55`); accent-derived chrome via alpha overlays (`d7da006cf`). Target: **hardcoded-value count ratchets to zero**.
- **Accent stays on the theme accent.** Hue drift budget: shader hue_shift ≤0.06, warm-side only — 0.10–0.16 rotates gold into green (`9fe049439`).
- **`.impeccable.md` is law:** opacity tiers, Raycast-style text grading, three-key footer, list-item anatomy, surface-layout decision rule, actions-dialog anatomy. Deviations need a documented owner + reason (CLAUDE.md contract).
- **A fix changes the real UI, not the audit** — token added AND applied (`d67df7cb4`).
- Interaction states are calibrated, not binary: hover sits visibly between idle and focused ("we need it like halfway between the focus strength and the 'nothing' strength", 2026-04-13); pressed/toggle == focused style (`.impeccable.md`).

**Proof:** `flows/auditor.md` sweeps enumerate raw values → convert to clippy disallowed-lists + shrink-only ratchet; de-drift contract tests for chrome constants (`66415737d`); component-reuse violations flagged in review against the CLAUDE.md shared-UI checklist.

## 6. Motion — calm, never decorative

Notably: John has *never* complained about missing animation — only about motion that exists and misbehaves. Default to less.

**The bar:**

- **Pulses breathe, never blink:** ≥2s cycle, opacity floor ≥0.6 (`a1e663f08`). Streaming states get a spinner, not a blinking cursor (2026-04-02).
- **No appear animation on modals** (`a158bf910`). No unnecessary animation at all — ".impeccable.md: no unnecessary animation, no visual noise".
- **Ambient effects are always-on subtle; change amplifies** — never fade to nothing at idle, never grab attention (`9fe049439`, `3fbb39b03`).
- **Hover state never churns during scroll** — suppress enter/leave while rows slide under a stationary pointer (`6c7950040`).

**Proof:** motion constants live in tokens (cycle ms, opacity floors) with a de-drift test; scroll-hover churn locked by the existing behavior fix + probe.

## 7. Materials & windows — native or nothing

**The bar:**

- **Vibrancy must actually read.** Material-led, not tint-led: Menu material + tint ≤0.30 + backdrop_saturation 2.6; target ~54% body saturation (Raycast's measured value) — a 0.85 neutral tint crushes it to ~15% (`f4cca5f55`). "Drastically lower the background opacity… so I can actually see the blur" (2026-03-23). Blur parity across ALL windows — main, notes, chat, dialogs (2026-03-24).
- **The footer blur trio is non-negotiable** (native NSVisualEffectView + hitTest:nil + deferred transparent hitbox) — never change one leg independently (memory: footer-blur-architecture). The list visibly scrolls behind the blurred footer (2026-04-07).
- **Non-activating overlay discipline:** the window interacts with the frontmost app Raycast-style (2026-03-25), never steals activation, never lingers on top after work ends (standing AFK feedback), and never ghost-flashes on unrelated shortcuts (2026-03-30). Overlay ordering hides siblings synchronously in the same unsafe block — no async flash gap (`2492acfa9`).
- **Chrome metrics are measured against native macOS, and refuted concerns are dropped, not "fixed"** (`1c71559a7`): 9pt input inset from a real NSTextField (`d67df7cb4`), 12pt footer gap at Apple's soft bezel floor (`ac3345ce9`).

**Proof:** screenshot + saturation measurement probes (the vibrancy work was won by measuring); window show/hide/z-order choreography probes via devtools getState — leave `windowVisible:false` after every pass.

## 8. States — every state is designed

**The bar:**

- **Loading is inline and non-blocking** — never a full-screen takeover when the input could be live (`f275c1eb3`).
- **Errors are dismissable callouts with a real Retry**, never dead-ends (`b85ee77b6`).
- **Zero-match shows a designed empty list**, not the unfiltered set (`0bb6d487a`), and empty states render inside the same container as the list (no list↔EmptyState container swap — audit P1).
- **Capped results say so** — follow established patterns or load more on scroll; never silently truncate (2026-05-12).
- **Sources surface without secret prefixes** — if browser history is enabled, "amazon" finds it without `tabs:` (2026-05-20).
- **Placeholder and ghost text teach**, they don't brand: "Search or type @ / | . ; for commands" (`9515cd69f`); ghost text must be substantive, not filler (2026-05-30).
- Rows show friendly names, never raw sigils (`777b99e8f`).

**Proof:** state-matrix walkthrough per surface (empty / error / loading / overflow / long-text / zero-match), screenshot each cell; undesigned cells become tickets.

## The standing loop

- **Nightly polish sweep:** auditor + escape + perf flows run against this doc; findings ranked by dimension order above; the AFK pipeline consumes the queue.
- **Every complaint becomes a lock.** The scar ledger was empty when this doc was written — every quote above had to be re-mined from raw transcripts. Going forward: friction moment → `/scar` → probe or eval → regression lock. Each irritation is felt exactly once, ever.
- **Recalibration:** the **(proposed)** numbers (50ms open/transition, 1ms sync-per-keystroke, 5ms sync-first-paint) need John's sign-off; everything else already has a receipt. Revisit budgets when hardware or GPUI vendor changes materially.
