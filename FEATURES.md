# Script Kit Feature Contracts

This document is generated from the `scriptkit-core-qa-50` web-choice submission and is the durable map from user-facing features to the QA proof we expect to keep stable while refactoring, fixing bugs, and adding features.

## Scope Rules

- Submission: `.hitl-choice/submissions/7526023d-9cdf-4ef2-8bd9-c6cad5938d46.json`.
- Active lock-in scope: 49 selected QA candidates.
- One selected candidate is omitted from this contract per product-scope feedback.
- Experimental: Mini Mode is documented as WIP only; it is not treated as a stable user contract yet.
- Terminology: user-facing docs use `Agent Chat with Pi Backend`; source files, tests, commands, and persisted choice ids use Agent Chat / Pi-backed Agent Chat names only.
- Main input cwd behavior: `>` must not select cwd; Tab is the cwd trigger.
- Cargo verification must use `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh`, not bare `cargo`.

## QA Lock-In Status

| Priority | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| P0 | 15 | Core daily workflows that should get first DevTools receipts. |
| P1 | 19 | Important support and recovery surfaces. |
| P2 | 15 | Lower-risk but still user-visible contracts. |

## Standard Proof Pattern

Every feature below should be locked with the smallest proof set that can fail for the contract:

1. A Script Kit DevTools runtime receipt when the behavior is visible or interactive.
2. A focused source or integration test through `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh`.
3. A documented blocker when a DevTools primitive is missing, including the exact missing primitive.
4. A `FEATURES.md` update when a contract changes intentionally.

## Memory Layer Surfaces (Brain Time)

New surfaces from the Brain Time work (`.notes/brain-time.md`). These are NOT
part of the `scriptkit-core-qa-50` QA lock-in submission — the Feature Matrix
below stays pinned to the 49 selected candidates. These entries graduate into
the matrix only through a future QA lock-in selection.

### Day Page opens in the main launcher window

- Stable anchor: `day-page-opens-in-main-launcher-window`
- Surface: Day Page / Main Launcher
- Status: Active (Brain Time T9), pending QA lock-in selection
- User contract: Tap-while-open toggles Script List ↔ Day Page in the same main window (no resize, no window swap). Today's `brain/days/YYYY-MM-DD.md` binds on entry; the shared notes editor (`day-page-editor`) persists edits through the brain substrate. Esc dismisses the main window.
- Regression risk: Gesture routing or `AppView` morph refactors can break in-place toggle, day rollover binding, or editor save semantics.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib day_page`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session brain-time --start --show --main --surface DayPage --limit 200`
- Pass evidence: Day-page unit tests pass; DevTools inspect shows `day-page-editor` and stable main-window bounds across launcher ↔ Day Page toggle.
- Fail evidence: Wrong view after toggle, missing editor semantic id, day file not created, or unit tests fail.

### Main hotkey gesture grammar morphs surfaces in place

- Stable anchor: `main-hotkey-gesture-grammar-morphs-surfaces`
- Surface: Main Launcher / Day Page / Agent Chat
- Status: Active (Brain Time T2/T8), pending QA lock-in selection
- User contract: Key-down shows the launcher immediately. Tap-while-open toggles launcher ↔ Day Page with query carry-over. Double-tap opens Agent Chat. Hold (~250ms) opens Day Page. Tap never dismisses — Esc is the only dismiss.
- Regression risk: Hotkey delivery or classifier wiring can regress instant show, retire tap-to-dismiss, or route gestures to the wrong surface.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib gesture`
  - `scripts/agentic/main-hotkey-gesture-probe.ts` (runtime receipt when available)
- Pass evidence: Gesture classifier unit tests pass; runtime probe shows stable window id across morphs and carry-over text in Day Page editor after toggle.
- Fail evidence: Delayed first paint, tap hides window, wrong surface after double-tap/hold, or classifier tests fail.

### Script Kit Brain substrate persists memory as markdown files

- Stable anchor: `script-kit-brain-substrate-markdown-canonical`
- Surface: Script Kit Brain / Storage
- Status: Active (Brain Time T1/T5/T7), pending QA lock-in selection
- User contract: User memory lives under `~/.scriptkit/brain/{days,fragments,notes,trash}` as plain markdown. Day-page appends are timestamped and append-only. Fragments split at the word threshold with excerpt + link on the day page. `brain.sqlite` and `notes.sqlite` are derived indexes rebuildable from files alone.
- Regression risk: Path construction outside `src/brain/substrate/`, partial writes, or indexer source drift can break the files-canonical contract.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib brain::substrate`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test notes`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib brain`
- Pass evidence: Substrate unit tests pass; notes rebuild-from-files test passes; brain indexer includes day pages and fragments.
- Fail evidence: Content only in sqlite, failed atomic writes, missing rebuild parity, or tests fail.

### Clipboard sediment keeps brain content without popup UI

- Stable anchor: `clipboard-sediment-no-popup`
- Surface: Clipboard History / Day Page
- Status: Active (Brain Time T4/T10/T12/T14), pending QA lock-in selection
- User contract: Secrets are rejected before storage. URLs auto-keep to today's day page. Non-URLs promote on re-copy. Copy tracking must not open a post-copy popup; auto-keeps may whisper "Kept". Day Page renders fragment excerpt cards and kept-URL links.
- Regression risk: Monitor ordering, sediment tiers, or post-copy popup regressions can leak secrets, skip keeps, or reintroduce surprise UI.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib clipboard_history`
  - `bun scripts/agentic/clipboard-post-copy-menu-probe.ts` (runtime no-popup receipt when available)
- Pass evidence: Rejection and sediment unit tests pass; runtime probe shows brain insertion with no post-copy popup target.
- Fail evidence: Rejected content stored, duplicate URL lines same day, copied content opens a post-copy popup, or tests fail.

## Feature Matrix

### Main launcher cold start renders the script list

- Stable anchor: `main-launcher-cold-start-renders-the-script-list`
- Choice id: `main-launcher-cold-start-surface-contract`
- Surface: Main Launcher
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: A visible focused main window reports promptType/surfaceContract for ScriptList, nonzero visible choices, stable input ownership, and usable semantic elements.
- Regression risk: Startup, route, or render refactors can leave the launcher blank, unfocused, uninspectable, or on the wrong surface while still compiling.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test smoke_main_menu -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: DevTools inspect receipt has classification ok, windowKind main, surface ScriptList, visible/focused true, and semantic element count greater than zero; smoke_main_menu passes.
- Fail evidence: Inspect returns blocked/error, no semantic elements, wrong surface, hidden/unfocused window, or the smoke test fails.

### Search selects and submits a script from the main launcher

- Stable anchor: `search-selects-and-submits-a-script-from-the-main-launcher`
- Choice id: `main-launcher-search-select-submit-script`
- Surface: Main Launcher / Script Execution
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Filtering updates inputValue and visible rows, selectedSemanticId belongs to the filtered result, and submit produces a guarded dispatch receipt without targeting a stale row.
- Regression risk: Filtering caches, selection ownership, submit diagnostics, or script routing can drift and cause the wrong script to launch or no launch at all.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/events.ts record --session core-qa --start --show -- bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text script --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Enter --allow-submit --submit-intent script-launch --allow-submit-reason core-qa-filtered-script-submit --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test submit_ownership_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Event and act receipts show input reconciliation, filtered selection, lifecycle dispatched/source-live, and source contract tests pass.
- Fail evidence: Receipt shows stale selectedSemanticId, submit blocked unexpectedly, wrong action host, no lifecycle dispatch, or contract tests fail.

### Root built-in dispatch opens the requested built-in

- Stable anchor: `root-built-in-dispatch-opens-the-requested-built-in`
- Choice id: `trigger-builtin-from-root-is-stable`
- Surface: Main Launcher / Built-ins
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: triggerBuiltin resolves canonical built-in ids case-insensitively, transitions to the expected built-in surface, and does not leave stale root state behind.
- Regression risk: Builtin registry, route, or deprecation work can silently break root commands or dispatch the wrong surface.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-clipboard","builtinId":"builtin/clipboard-history"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --main --surface ClipboardHistory --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test trigger_builtin_route_golden -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test trigger_builtin_dispatch_view_agnostic_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: RPC result is ok, inspect lands on the requested built-in surface, and trigger builtin route/dispatch contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Unknown/legacy id error, wrong surface, stale ScriptList still active, or route/dispatch contracts fail.

### Cmd+K actions target the current row

- Stable anchor: `cmd-k-actions-target-the-current-row`
- Choice id: `cmd-k-actions-popup-targets-current-row`
- Surface: Actions / Cmd+K
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Cmd+K/open-actions creates an ActionsDialog with parent subject identity, selectable actions, stable focus, and Escape returns to the parent surface with the same or intentionally updated selection.
- Regression risk: Actions refactors can detach from the wrong item, lose parent surface ownership, or close the parent window unexpectedly.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/actions.ts inspect --session core-qa --start --open --keep-open --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Escape --target-kind actionsDialog --strict`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test actions_dialog_enter_routing_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test actions_popup_parent_preserves_semantic_surface_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Actions receipt shows open dialog, parentSubjectId/text, selectable actions, dismissal classified as dismissed/source-live, and contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Dialog fails to open, parent identity is missing, Escape kills the parent, selection changes unexpectedly, or contracts fail.

### Escape and focus loss preserve the right state

- Stable anchor: `escape-and-focus-loss-preserve-the-right-state`
- Choice id: `escape-go-back-hide-preserves-state`
- Surface: Main Launcher / Window Focus
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Escape clears filters, goes back from built-ins opened from main, or hides only the main panel according to route state; Notes/Agent Chat with Pi Backend windows remain alive.
- Regression risk: Hide/reset refactors can app-hide secondary windows, clear state too aggressively, or trap the user on a stale route.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/events.ts record --session core-qa --start --show -- bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Escape --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test main_focus_loss_preserve_state_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test hide_rpc_surface_reset_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Receipt classifies Escape as safe dismissal/clear/back behavior and source tests prove no direct app-hide/reset drift.
- Fail evidence: Escape hides the wrong window, leaves stale route/filter state, loses secondary windows, or source contracts fail.

### Agent Chat accepts a prompt and exposes response lifecycle

- Stable anchor: `agent-chat-accepts-a-prompt-and-exposes-response-lifecycle`
- Choice id: `agent-chat-submit-stream-lifecycle`
- Surface: Agent Chat / Agent Chat with Pi Backend
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: The composer accepts text, Cmd+Enter/Enter submit is allowed only with proof intent, message count or awaiting-first-assistant state changes, and Agent Chat with Pi Backend state remains targetable.
- Regression risk: Chat routing, submit gates, or streaming state can drift and make prompt submission unsafe or unobservable.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --surface AgentChat --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text 'Core QA hello' --main --strict --surface AgentChat`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Enter --modifiers cmd --allow-submit --submit-intent agent-chat-route --allow-submit-reason core-qa-agent-chat-submit --main --strict --surface AgentChat`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test agent_chat_runtime_seam_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test tab_ai_harness_submission -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Receipts show composer text, guarded submit dispatch, Agent Chat with Pi Backend/chat state transition, and chat harness/source contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Submit blocked without clear gate, wrong target, no state transition, transcript unavailable, or contracts fail.

### Agent Chat with Pi Backend context selector accepts @ items with receipts

- Stable anchor: `agent-chat-with-pi-backend-context-selector-accepts-items-with-receipts`
- Choice id: `agent_chat-context-selector-acceptance-receipts`
- Surface: Agent Chat / Context Selector
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Agent Chat state and test probe receipts show selector open, selected item, acceptedViaKey, cursorAfter, contextChipCount, and final input layout after acceptance.
- Regression risk: Selector keyboard routing and context insertion are easy to break during composer or context refactors.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"resetAgentChatTestProbe","requestId":"core-qa-reset-probe","target":{"type":"main"}}' --expect agent_chatTestProbeResult --timeout 8000`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text '@' --main --strict --surface AgentChat`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Tab --main --strict --surface AgentChat`
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"getAgentChatTestProbe","requestId":"core-qa-probe","tail":4,"target":{"type":"main"}}' --expect agent_chatTestProbeResult --timeout 8000`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test agent_chat_mention_popup_registry_lifecycle_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Probe receipt contains keyRoutes and acceptedItems with acceptedViaKey tab/enter, cursorAfter, and context state; popup lifecycle contract passes.
- Fail evidence: Selector never opens, acceptedItems stays empty, cursor/chip count is wrong, event route is propagated incorrectly, or contract fails.

### Detached Agent Chat with Pi Backend targets, reattaches, and cleans up

- Stable anchor: `detached-agent-chat-with-pi-backend-targets-reattaches-and-cleans-up`
- Choice id: `agent_chat-detached-targeting-and-close-cleanup`
- Surface: Agent Chat / Detached Agent Chat with Pi Backend
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Detached Agent Chat with Pi Backend windows appear in listAutomationWindows, inspect target resolves by kind/id, reattach identity is stable, and close cleanup removes only the detached host.
- Regression risk: Detached windows are prone to stale registry entries, wrong-window reads, and leaked popups after refactors.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --target-kind agentChatDetached --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/surface.ts inspect --surface AgentChat --target-kind agentChatDetached`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test agent_chat_reattach_identity_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test detached_agent_chat_close_cleanup_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Window inventory/inspect identifies agentChatDetached with full or acceptable semantic quality, reattach id remains stable, and close cleanup contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Target resolution fails, detached and main state are mixed, registry remains after close, or contracts fail.

### Notes edit state survives main-window activity

- Stable anchor: `notes-edit-state-survives-main-window-activity`
- Choice id: `notes-edit-persist-main-hide-isolation`
- Surface: Notes
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Notes window is targetable, editor semantic id/input state is present, content changes are reflected in notes_state, and main hide/back actions do not close or reset Notes.
- Regression risk: Window lifecycle changes can app-hide Notes, drop editor focus, or lose unsaved note state.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/notes.ts inspect --session core-qa --start --open --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key Escape --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/notes.ts inspect --session core-qa --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test notes_transaction_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test notes_devtools_state_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Notes receipts show visible editor before and after main interaction, stable editor state, and Notes contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Notes closes, editor state disappears, focus target corrupts, or source contracts fail.

### Dictation fixture delivery records a safe target receipt

- Stable anchor: `dictation-fixture-delivery-records-a-safe-target-receipt`
- Choice id: `dictation-fixture-delivery-target-receipts`
- Surface: Dictation
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: pushDictationResult advances lastDelivery generation, records target/destination/insertionRange, stores transcript fingerprint/length, and never returns raw transcript content.
- Regression risk: Dictation delivery touches cross-window text insertion and privacy-sensitive receipts, both easy to regress.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/dictation.ts deliver-fixture --session core-qa --start --show --target mainWindowFilter --fixture-id short-phrase`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/dictation.ts deliver-fixture --session core-qa --target notesEditor --fixture-id punctuation`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test push_dictation_result_stub_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test dictation_lifecycle_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Dictation receipts classify ok or a specific missing primitive, include redacted fingerprint/length and target match, and contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Raw transcript leaks, generation does not advance, target mismatches, insertion range missing without explicit blocker, or contracts fail.

### Clipboard history search, preview, pin, and delete work

- Stable anchor: `clipboard-history-search-preview-pin-and-delete-work`
- Choice id: `clipboard-history-search-preview-actions`
- Surface: Clipboard History
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Clipboard History exposes filter-aware elements, preview type metadata, pin/delete/bulk-delete receipts, and stable empty-state behavior.
- Regression risk: Clipboard is high-frequency and prone to stale filters, wrong preview types, and accidental destructive action drift.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-clip-open","builtinId":"builtin/clipboard-history"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --main --surface ClipboardHistory --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test clipboard_history_getelements_filter_aware_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test clipboard_history_preview_type_filters_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test clipboard_bulk_delete_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Inspect shows ClipboardHistory elements/preview state and clipboard contracts pass for filter-aware rows, preview types, and bulk delete safety.
- Fail evidence: Surface cannot open, elements ignore filters, preview type mismatches row type, destructive receipt missing, or contracts fail.

### File Search handles paths, search, selection, and verbs

- Stable anchor: `file-search-handles-paths-search-selection-and-verbs`
- Choice id: `file-search-path-search-select-verbs`
- Surface: File Search
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: File Search resolves tilde/start paths, refreshes after mutations, exposes selectable file rows, and actions/drag verbs carry the exact selected path.
- Regression risk: Filesystem surfaces commonly regress around path expansion, stale rows after mutation, and wrong-path actions.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-file-open","builtinId":"builtin/file-search"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --main --surface FileSearch --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test file_search_tilde_entry -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test file_search_drag_and_verbs -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test file_search_mutation_refresh -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Inspect shows FileSearch rows/preview and source contracts pass for tilde entry, selected-path verbs, drag metadata, and mutation refresh.
- Fail evidence: Wrong path expansion, no rows/preview, selected action path mismatch, stale mutation state, or contract failure.

### Stdin batch transactions produce replay-safe traces

- Stable anchor: `stdin-batch-transactions-produce-replay-safe-traces`
- Choice id: `stdin-batch-transaction-trace-idempotent`
- Surface: Stdin Protocol / Transactions
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Batch commands return ordered results, failedAt is correct, trace includes before/after snapshots and command_fingerprint, and same requestId with same payload is idempotent.
- Regression risk: Automation protocol drift breaks every DevTools/runtime receipt and makes QA locks unreliable.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"batch","requestId":"core-qa-batch-script","target":{"type":"main"},"commands":[{"type":"setInput","text":"script"},{"type":"waitFor","condition":"choicesRendered","timeout":5000}],"trace":"on"}' --expect batchResult --timeout 8000`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test protocol_batch -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test tx_trace_replay_idempotency_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: batchResult success has per-command results and trace, replay returns same trace or conflict only for changed payload, and protocol tests pass.
- Fail evidence: Missing trace, wrong command order, non-idempotent replay, requestId conflict mishandled, or tests fail.

### Automation targets the intended window, not the focused accident

- Stable anchor: `automation-targets-the-intended-window-not-the-focused-accident`
- Choice id: `automation-window-targeting-strict-all-core-windows`
- Surface: Automation / Window Targeting
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: listAutomationWindows and inspectAutomationWindow resolve explicit targets, include window id/kind/bounds/osWindowId when available, and never silently fall back to the wrong focused window.
- Regression risk: Any runtime QA suite depends on strict targeting; target drift makes receipts false positives.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/surfaces.ts`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --main --strict --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --target-kind notes --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --target-kind actionsDialog --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test automation_window_targeting -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test screenshot_identity_threading_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Receipts show exact target identity for each available window and tests pass for target resolution and screenshot identity.
- Fail evidence: Target resolves to focused/main unexpectedly, id/kind missing, screenshot identity mismatches, or contracts fail.

### Permission preflight guides the user without surprise prompts

- Stable anchor: `permission-preflight-guides-the-user-without-surprise-prompts`
- Choice id: `permissions-preflight-guides-user-without-surprise-prompts`
- Surface: Permissions / Preflight
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Permission state is visible in getState/mainWindowPreflight or setup snapshots, actions are explicit, and source audits confirm no hidden prompt path bypasses the permission guide.
- Regression risk: Permission regressions are high-risk because they block core workflows and can surprise users with native prompts.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test permission_guide_assistant_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test ai_preflight_generation_guard_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test platform_accessibility_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Inspect receipt exposes preflight/permission state when relevant and source contracts pass for permission guide, AI preflight guard, and accessibility wiring.
- Fail evidence: Missing permission has no surfaced guidance, hidden prompt path appears, preflight is stale, or contracts fail.

### Main input sigils project the right catalogs

- Stable anchor: `main-input-sigils-project-the-right-catalogs`
- Choice id: `spine-sigils-project-main-input-catalogs`
- Surface: Main Input / Spine
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Each sigil parses to the expected segment kind, renders the expected catalog rows, and accepts insertion/resolution without corrupting free-text tail input.
- Regression risk: Prompt-builder grammar and row projection can drift subtly and make common shortcuts unusable.
- Feedback lock: `>` must not select cwd. Tab is the cwd trigger.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text '@file:' --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/elements.ts snapshot --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib spine -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Runtime elements show the projected catalog for the active sigil and spine unit tests pass for parse/projection/list rows.
- Fail evidence: Wrong catalog, broken highlighting/span range, lost tail text, or spine tests fail.

### Root source filters browse unified launcher sources

- Stable anchor: `root-source-filters-browse-unified-launcher-sources`
- Choice id: `root-unified-source-filters-browse-and-actions`
- Surface: Main Launcher / Unified Sources
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Source filter chips or syntax update visible rows, source metadata, action policies, and passive snapshots without mixing rows from inactive sources.
- Regression risk: Unified source refactors can bleed actions and rows between source domains, causing wrong launches or stale previews.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test menu_syntax_source_filters -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test main_menu_result_cache_domain_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test filterable_surface_agentic_matrix_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Inspect shows active source metadata/rows and source filter/cache-domain contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Rows from one source appear under another, actions mismatch source, passive snapshot is stale, or tests fail.

### App Launcher searches apps and reports activation feedback

- Stable anchor: `app-launcher-searches-apps-and-reports-activation-feedback`
- Choice id: `app-launcher-search-activation-feedback`
- Surface: App Launcher
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: App rows are visible and selectable, activation attempts produce feedback, and empty-state behavior is explicit when no apps match.
- Regression risk: App launch is a core user path that can regress through filtering, action feedback, or empty-state changes.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-app-launcher","builtinId":"builtin/app-launcher"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --main --surface AppLauncher --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test app_launcher_visible_rows_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test app_launcher_activation_feedback_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: AppLauncher inspect shows rows or empty state and contracts pass for visible rows and activation feedback.
- Fail evidence: Surface fails to open, rows lack selectable app metadata, activation gives no feedback, or contracts fail.

### Current App Commands shows safe commands for the frontmost app

- Stable anchor: `current-app-commands-shows-safe-commands-for-the-frontmost-app`
- Choice id: `current-app-commands-visible-actions`
- Surface: Current App Commands
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Rows include frontmost-app command metadata, visible/empty states are explicit, and action sources match current-app command audits.
- Regression risk: Frontmost app observation and command action wiring can drift, making commands target the wrong application.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-current-app","builtinId":"builtin/current-app-commands"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`

- Surface: Browser Tabs / Browser History
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Browser built-ins expose filter-aware rows with source metadata, open actions target the selected item, and empty states are explicit.
- Regression risk: Browser providers vary by environment; surfaces must not look broken when data is unavailable.
- Proof commands:
  - `bash scripts/agentic/session.sh rpc core-qa '{"type":"triggerBuiltin","requestId":"core-qa-browser-tabs","builtinId":"builtin/browser-tabs"}' --expect triggerBuiltinResult --timeout 8000`

- Stable anchor: `actions-dialog-keyboard-navigation-keeps-a-valid-selection`
- Choice id: `actions-dialog-keyboard-selection-invariants`
- Surface: Actions Dialog
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Arrow navigation skips headers, selection never leaves selectable bounds, Enter routes according to action policy, and Escape closes the dialog without mutating parent state.
- Regression risk: Keyboard handling regressions make actions feel broken and can dispatch the wrong action.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/actions.ts inspect --session core-qa --start --open --keep-open --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts key --key ArrowDown --target-kind actionsDialog --strict`

- Surface: Actions / Popup Lifecycle
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Action receipts classify source-live, source-closed-parent-live, dismissed, or failed with parentAfter/sourceAfter details.
- Regression risk: Action lifecycle bugs can leave orphan popups, close the main window, or run actions against stale parent state.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/events.ts record --session core-qa --start --show -- bun scripts/devtools/actions.ts inspect --open --keep-open --main --surface ScriptList --limit 200`

- Surface: Mini Mode
- Status: Experimental/WIP documentation only
- User contract: Mini window reports correct semantic surface, sizing constraints, focused input, filtered-row reveal, and clean reset on close/toggle.
- Regression risk: Mini mode touches alternate chrome and input routing, making it easy to regress during launcher changes.
- Feedback lock: keep this as experimental/WIP documentation until Mini Mode behavior is intentionally stabilized.
- Proof commands:

- Choice id: `context-selector-add-to-ai-end-to-end`
- Surface: Context Selector / Add to AI
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Context part resolution produces source-specific attachments, composer state records chips, preflight blocks unavailable sources, and submission carries the expected context parts.
- Regression risk: Context handoff connects many sources; drift can silently drop or mislabel what the user asked AI to use.

- Pass evidence: Inspect shows informational surface content and contracts pass for About, Help, and Confirm.
- Fail evidence: Missing content/actions, wrong focus, confirm/cancel semantics drift, or tests fail.

### DevTools inspect, elements, layout, and measure produce trustworthy receipts

- Stable anchor: `devtools-inspect-elements-layout-and-measure-produce-trustworthy-receipts`
- Choice id: `devtools-inspect-elements-layout-measure-truth`
- Surface: Script Kit DevTools
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: inspect/elements/layout/measure agree on target identity and report missing primitives explicitly instead of false success.
- Regression risk: The QA program depends on DevTools receipts; false positives or inconsistent target identity invalidate later locked tests.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --strict --surface ScriptList --limit 200 > /tmp/core-qa-inspect.json`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/elements.ts snapshot --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/layout.ts measure --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList --include nodes,regions,scroll,anchors,resize,overlaps --limit 200`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/measure.ts --inspect /tmp/core-qa-inspect.json --surface main`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test devtools_inspect_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test devtools_truth_execution_receipts_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Receipts have consistent target identity and explicit capability/missingFields; DevTools contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Primitive returns invalid JSON, target mismatch, false ok despite missing data, or tests fail.

### DevTools act, events, coverage, and sessions form replayable proofs

- Stable anchor: `devtools-act-events-coverage-and-sessions-form-replayable-proofs`
- Choice id: `devtools-act-events-coverage-session-lifecycle`
- Surface: Script Kit DevTools / Sessions
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: events record captures child command output, act receipts include lifecycle and safety gates, coverage reports known surfaces/missing primitives, and session cleanup is reliable.
- Regression risk: Without stable recording and coverage, future QA choices cannot be audited or replayed.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/events.ts record --session core-qa --start --show --output /tmp/core-qa-events.json -- bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/coverage.ts --surface main`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test devtools_act_lifecycle_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test devtools_coverage_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test devtools_session_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Events receipt embeds child receipt, coverage reports surface status, and DevTools lifecycle/session contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Recorder drops child output, safety gates absent, coverage stale, session cleanup fails, or contracts fail.

### MCP resources and tools expose Script Kit state consistently

- Stable anchor: `mcp-resources-and-tools-expose-script-kit-state-consistently`
- Choice id: `mcp-resources-and-tools-contracts`
- Surface: MCP Resources / Tools
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: MCP resource URIs and tools return stable schemas, observation-only computer resources stay non-mutating, and SDK reference aligns with runtime docs.
- Regression risk: MCP drift breaks agent integrations and creates mismatches between UI and programmatic surfaces.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_scripts_tools -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_notes_tools -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_clipboard_tools -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_config_tools -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_resource_drift -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test mcp_resources_sdk_reference -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: MCP tests pass with stable schemas and no mutation in observation-only resources.
- Fail evidence: Schema drift, missing resource, unsafe mutation, SDK mismatch, or test failure.

### Protocol versioning, deprecations, and parse recovery are stable

- Stable anchor: `protocol-versioning-deprecations-and-parse-recovery-are-stable`
- Choice id: `protocol-version-deprecation-and-error-recovery`
- Surface: Stdin Protocol / Compatibility
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Known messages parse, unknown/invalid lines are skipped gracefully, unsupported protocolVersion increments stats, and deprecated fields warn or error by configured version.
- Regression risk: Protocol compatibility work can accidentally break older SDKs or crash on future/invalid messages.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --lib protocol -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test stdin_parse_error_recovery_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test stdin_protocol_version_dispatch_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test protocol_stats_report_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Protocol and stdin tests pass for parse recovery, version dispatch, deprecation, and stats reporting.
- Fail evidence: Unknown/future message crashes, unsupported version not counted, deprecation policy ignored, or tests fail.

### Automation screenshots carry strict identity and nonblank proof

- Stable anchor: `automation-screenshots-carry-strict-identity-and-nonblank-proof`
- Choice id: `automation-screenshots-screenshot-identity`
- Surface: Automation / Screenshots
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: captureScreenshot/inspectAutomationWindow returns screenshot identity, target bounds, optional osWindowId, nonblank content, and semantic elements that match the target.
- Regression risk: Visual proofs can become misleading if screenshots target the wrong window or lose identity metadata.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/inspect.ts --session core-qa --start --show --main --strict --hi-dpi --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test automation_screenshots -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test state_result_screenshot_identity_contract -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test verify_shot_strict_window_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Inspect receipt has screenshot dimensions/identity and screenshot tests pass for strict target/nonblank proof.
- Fail evidence: Blank screenshot, wrong window, missing identity/bounds, semantic mismatch, or tests fail.

### Startup stays event-driven and avoids blocking regressions

- Stable anchor: `startup-stays-event-driven-and-avoids-blocking-regressions`
- Choice id: `startup-performance-event-driven-no-blocking-regression`
- Surface: Startup / Performance
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Startup contracts confirm event-driven initialization, new-action startup state, and no known blocking regressions in shared startup paths.
- Regression risk: Performance regressions may not break functional tests but can make the core launcher feel dead.
- Proof commands:
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test startup_perf_event_driven -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test main_window_preflight -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test app_state_domain_structs_contract -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Startup/performance source contracts pass and report no blocking startup path regression.
- Fail evidence: Startup state blocks, preflight stale, app state domain drift, or tests fail.

### Plugin skills are discoverable and launchable

- Stable anchor: `plugin-skills-are-discoverable-and-launchable`
- Choice id: `plugin-skill-inventory-launch-and-search`
- Surface: Plugin Skills
- Status: Active QA lock-in candidate
- User contract: Plugin skill inventory exposes expected rows/source metadata, search finds skills, and launch dispatch uses the plugin runtime owner.
- Regression risk: Skills extend core workflows; inventory or launch drift makes installed skills disappear or run under the wrong owner.
- Proof commands:
  - `bun scripts/devtools/act.ts set-input --text 'type:skill' --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList`
  - `bun scripts/devtools/elements.ts snapshot --session core-qa --main --strict --surface ScriptList --limit 200`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test plugin_inventory -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test plugin_skill_search -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test plugin_skill_launch -- --nocapture`
  - `./scripts/agentic/agent-cargo.sh test --test plugin_skill_main_menu -- --nocapture`
- Pass evidence: Runtime filter exposes skill rows when available and plugin inventory/search/launch/main-menu contracts pass.
- Fail evidence: Skills missing from inventory, wrong runtime owner, launch route stale, or tests fail.

## Submission Feedback Applied

- `spine-sigils-project-main-input-catalogs`: `>` no longer selects cwd; Tab is the cwd trigger.
- One selected candidate was removed from active scope per product-scope feedback.
- `mini-mode-toggle-size-filter-reveal`: documented as experimental/WIP only.
- Overall: legacy Agent Chat backend naming is replaced with `Agent Chat with Pi Backend` in user-facing feature language.
