# Task: Research Current Button Styles in Codebase

Search the entire codebase for all button implementations. Find:
1. All files that define or render buttons (look for `Button`, `button`, `.on_click`, clickable elements)
2. Document what cursor styles are currently being used
3. List all button variants and their styling patterns
4. Identify inconsistencies in button styling

Focus on:
- `src/` directory for Rust/GPUI button code
- Any CSS/Tailwind classes used for buttons
- The `gpui-component` button implementations

Output a summary of all button implementations found with file paths and line numbers.
