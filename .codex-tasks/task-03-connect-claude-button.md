# Task: Find and Fix "Connect to Claude Code" Button

Search for any button labeled "Connect to Claude Code" or similar:
1. Find where this button is defined
2. Check what happens when clicked - trace the click handler
3. If the button does nothing visible, add a HUD notification or toast

The button should either:
- Perform its action AND show visual feedback (HUD/toast)
- Show a "Coming soon" or "Not implemented" message if incomplete

Look for patterns like:
- "Claude" in button labels
- "Connect" buttons
- MCP or integration buttons

Implement proper feedback for any buttons that currently do nothing visible.
