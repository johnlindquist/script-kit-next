# Task: Create/Enhance Reusable Button Component

Check if there's a consistent Button component and enhance it:

1. Look for existing Button struct/component in the codebase
2. If it exists, ensure it has:
   - Consistent cursor_pointer()
   - Hover states
   - Active/pressed states
   - Disabled state handling
   - Theme-aware colors
3. If no standard Button component exists, note where one should be created

The goal is to have ONE button implementation that all UI uses, ensuring consistency.

Document findings and make improvements to any existing Button component.
