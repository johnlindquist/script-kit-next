      "task": "Fix the webcam actions window dialog to have the same behavior as the main window actions dialog. The main window has an actions dialog (likely in src/actions.rs or similar) that supports search, focus, keyboard navigation, etc. The webcam prompt (src/prompts/webcam* or similar) has its own actions dialog that behaves differently. Make the webcam actions dialog use the same shared actions component/behavior as the main window so all actions menu dialogs are consistent. Check src/app_impl.rs for how actions are dispatched, src/prompts/ for prompt-specific action handling, and src/actions.rs for the shared actions dialog. Ensure search/filter, keyboard focus, escape handling, and item selection all work identically.",
