Common culprits in GPUI apps: (1) cx.notify() being called in a tight loop or timer that fires too often, (2) unnecessary re-renders on every frame, (3) expensive computations in render() methods that should be cached, (4) subscriptions or observers triggering cascading updates. Focus on the AI chat rendering path - find where the chat view is defined and rendered, trace what happens on idle (no user input), and eliminate any hot loops, excessive notifications, or redundant work. Check for any polling, timers, or animation loops that run continuously. The fix should make the chat window feel snappy and responsive when idle.",

(a) Sidebar chat list items need more left padding - they're cramped against the left edge. (b) The main chat conversation area needs more horizontal padding on both sides so messages have breathing room. (c) Chat message bubbles (both user and assistant) need slightly more internal padding.

Make them much more subtle: use a muted/dim text label instead of bright colored pill badges. They should be secondary information, not screaming for attention. The green 'Snippet', purple 'Snippet', orange 'App', yellow 'Command' badges need to become understated text labels with muted colors.\n\n2. CATEGORY TEXT (e.g. 'Clipboard Variables', 'Clipboard Transformations') shown next to 'paste' - This metadata is too prominent. Either hide it entirely during search, or make it very dim/small so it doesn't compete with the item name.\n\n3. TRIGGER/SHORTCUT TEXT (!cb, !quote, !code, !htmllink, !mdlink, !upper) - These trigger shortcuts shown as bordered pills are adding visual clutter. Make them more subtle - dim text, smaller, or only show on hover/focus.\n\n4. ACTION VERB ('paste', 'open') - The action verb shown before category text adds noise. Hide it during search results or make it much more subtle.\n\n5. CHARACTER MATCH HIGHLIGHTING - The bold yellow character highlighting scattered through item names (e.g. bold 'C', 'l', 'i', 'p' in 'Clipboard') is too aggressive. Use a subtler highlight - maybe just a slightly brighter text color or light underline rather than bold+color on each matched character.\n\n6. DESCRIPTION TEXT - When items show a second line of description text (like truncated content previews), make sure it's properly dimmed and doesn't compete with the primary name.\n\nThe goal is: search results should look almost as clean as the no-search state, with type info available but not screaming.
