Before editing any file, you MUST claim it.\\nCommands (run via shell):\\n  - View roster: ~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts status\\n  - Claim files (blocks until free): ~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts claim --wait --id codex-fix-icon-consistency path/to/file\\n  - Release: ~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts release --id codex-fix-icon-consistency path/to/file\\n  - Update status/notes: ~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts update --id codex-fix-icon-consistency --status in_progress --notes \\\"...\\\"\\nRules:\\n  - Never edit a file you haven't claimed.\\n  - Keep claims tight (claim only what you're actively changing).\\n  - If blocked, set status=blocked and say what you're waiting on.\\n  - When finished, set status=done and release claims.\\n\\n## Development practices (this code is maintained by AI agents)\\n  - Log state transitions with enough context to diagnose failures from logs alone.\\n  - Structured errors: include what was attempted, what failed, and current state.\\n  - Name things for grepability — unique identifiers agents can find on the first search.\\n  - Every behavior change gets a test. Untested code is invisible to the next agent.\\n  - Test names describe the scenario: test_X_does_Y_when_Z.\\n  - Keep functions small and single-purpose. 500-line functions burn agent context.\\n  - Use types to encode constraints (enums > strings for errors).\\n\\n## CRITICAL: Parallel-safe verification\\n  - Other agents are modifying other files RIGHT NOW. Full test suites WILL show their failures.\\n  - ONLY run tests that cover YOUR changed files. Scope every test/check command:\\n    Rust: cargo test -p your-crate -- module::test_name | JS: npx jest your/file.test.ts\\n  - Do NOT run: cargo test (unscoped), cargo check (whole workspace), npm test (unscoped).\\n  - If a scoped test fails, it's YOUR bug — fix it. If tests outside your scope fail, ignore them.\\n\\n## Git commit discipline\\n  - NEVER commit unverified work. Run tests/lints/type-checks FIRST. If it fails, fix it before committing.\\n  - A commit is a declaration: \\\"this works and here's the proof.\\\"\\n  - Commit FREQUENTLY — after each meaningful unit of VERIFIED work, not just at the end.\\n  - A \\\"unit\\\" = one logical change that passes verification (new function, bug fix, refactor, test added).\\n  - NEVER batch an entire task into one giant commit. Small commits are searchable; big ones aren't.\\n  - Commit message format:\\n      Line 1: <type>(<scope>): <what changed> (imperative, max 72 chars)\\n      Line 3+: WHY this change was made, WHAT was verified, and HOW to test it.\\n    Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore\\n    Example:\\n      feat(auth): add refresh token rotation\\n      \\n      Tokens now rotate on each refresh call to prevent replay attacks.\\n      The old token is invalidated immediately on rotation.\\n      \\n      Verified: cargo test --lib -- auth::refresh (4 tests pass)\\n      Verified: manual smoke test via curl — token rotates, old token returns 401\\n  - The \\\"Verified:\\\" lines are REQUIRED. Future agents will read git log to understand\\n    what was tested and how to re-verify. This is the most valuable part of the message.\\n  - In your final message, list all commits you made with their hashes.\\n\\n## Time budget\\nYou have approximately 10 minutes.

Your assignment:
- Task: CONSISTENCY FIX: Ensure all actions have appropriate icons from IconName. Review all Action::new calls in src/actions/builders/*.rs. Currently some actions have icons and some don't. Ensure: (1) Every action that represents a primary operation has an icon (2) Icons are from the IconName enum, not hardcoded strings (3) Similar actions across different builders use the same icon (e.g. all 'copy' actions use the same copy icon, all 'open' actions use the same open icon).

Operating constraints:
- Single working tree (no worktrees, no patches).
- You MUST claim files before editing (~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts claim --wait ...).

Deliverables:
- Make the code changes required by the task.
- Run the most relevant tests/linters.
- In your FINAL message, include: changed files, how to test, and any risks/known gaps.

I’m starting implementation on `scriptlet.rs` first since it’s currently free; I’ll claim it, add icon assignments for primary actions, and add a focused test that locks icon consistency for copy/open/edit/run operations.

**Defining consistent action-to-icon mappings**

// # Architecture Overview

// The actions system is **intentionally decoupled** from the standard selection callbacks:
//
// - **on_select callback is bypassed by design** for keyboard navigation
// - Actions route through `handle_action()` in the main app via keyboard events
// - This enables consistent keyboard-driven action execution across all contexts
//
// ## Key Types
//
// - [`Action`]: Represents a single action item with id, title, category, and optional shortcut
// - [`ActionCategory`]: Categorizes actions (ScriptContext, ScriptOps, GlobalOps)
// - [`ScriptInfo`]: Context about the focused script/item for building context-specific actions
//
// ## Action ID Conventions

I’ve locked the icon mapping and I’m now patching `scriptlet.rs`: adding `IconName` imports, setting icons for run/edit/copy/reveal/settings/destructive actions, and adding an assertion test to enforce those icons.

**Deciding to release scriptlet to unblock**
codex
I finished `scriptlet.rs` edits and I’m releasing that claim now to unblock the other worker. I’ll continue waiting on `chat.rs` claim and then apply the same icon consistency pass there.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc '~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts release --id codex-fix-icon-consistency src/actions/builders/scriptlet.rs' in /Users/johnlindquist/dev/script-kit-gpui succeeded in 51ms:
Released for codex-fix-icon-consistency: src/actions/builders/scriptlet.rs

**Identifying file path requirement**
codex
`clipboard.rs` is updated with icon coverage across paste/copy/share/pin/save/delete actions plus a targeted icon consistency test. I’m claiming `file_path.rs` next.

**Checking claim status**
codex
`file_path.rs` is updated with explicit icons for open/reveal/copy/editor/terminal/trash actions and a test that enforces shared copy-icon usage across file/path contexts. I’m moving to claim `notes.rs` and `script_context.rs` next.

**Releasing resource claims to reduce contention**
codex
I’m releasing `chat.rs`, `clipboard.rs`, and `file_path.rs` now since their icon edits are complete, so other queued agents can proceed while I continue waiting on `notes.rs` and `script_context.rs`.

**Verifying icon usage in notes actions**
codex
I’ve acquired `notes.rs` now. I’m quickly confirming it already satisfies icon requirements end-to-end, and I’m still queued for `script_context.rs` which is the remaining file that lacks icon coverage.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "nl -ba src/actions/builders/notes.rs | sed -n '1,760p'" in /Users/johnlindquist/dev/script-kit-gpui succeeded in 50ms:
