Untested code is invisible to the next agent.\\n  - Test names describe the scenario: test_X_does_Y_when_Z.\\n  - Keep functions small and single-purpose. 500-line functions burn agent context.\\n  - Use types to encode constraints (enums > strings for errors).\\n\\n## CRITICAL: Parallel-safe verification\\n  - Other agents are modifying other files RIGHT NOW. Full test suites WILL show their failures.\\n  - ONLY run tests that cover YOUR changed files. Scope every test/check command:\\n    Rust: cargo test -p your-crate -- module::test_name | JS: npx jest your/file.test.ts\\n  - Do NOT run: cargo test (unscoped), cargo check (whole workspace), npm test (unscoped).\\n  - If a scoped test fails, it's YOUR bug — fix it. If tests outside your scope fail, ignore them.\\n\\n## Git commit discipline\\n  - NEVER commit unverified work. Run tests/lints/type-checks FIRST. If it fails, fix it before committing.\\n  - A commit is a declaration: \\\"this works and here's the proof.\\\"\\n  - Commit FREQUENTLY — after each meaningful unit of VERIFIED work, not just at the end.\\n  - A \\\"unit\\\" = one logical change that passes verification (new function, bug fix, refactor, test added).\\n  - NEVER batch an entire task into one giant commit. Small commits are searchable; big ones aren't.\\n  - Commit message format:\\n      Line 1: <type>(<scope>): <what changed> (imperative, max 72 chars)\\n      Line 3+: WHY this change was made, WHAT was verified, and HOW to test it.\\n    Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore\\n    Example:\\n      feat(auth): add refresh token rotation\\n      \\n      Tokens now rotate on each refresh call to prevent replay attacks.\\n      The old token is invalidated immediately on rotation.\\n      \\n      Verified: cargo test --lib -- auth::refresh (4 tests pass)\\n      Verified: manual smoke test via curl — token rotates, old token returns 401\\n  - The \\\"Verified:\\\" lines are REQUIRED.

Your assignment:
- Task: CONSISTENCY FIX: Make all action labels follow verb-first title case style consistently. Labels should: (1) Start with a verb ('Open', 'Copy', 'Show', 'Edit', 'Delete') (2) Use Title Case (3) No trailing ellipsis unless there IS a sub-dialog (4) Be concise (under 30 chars). Review and fix labels in src/actions/builders/script_context.rs - this is the largest builder. After fix, run cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
- Scope: src/actions/builders/script_context.rs

Operating constraints:
- Single working tree (no worktrees, no patches).
- You MUST claim files before editing (~/.claude/bin/swarm.ts claim --wait ...).

Deliverables:
- Make the code changes required by the task.
- Run the most relevant tests/linters.
- In your FINAL message, include: changed files, how to test, and any risks/known gaps.

**Clarifying command and commit approach**
codex
I’m taking the `codex-fix-label-style` task for `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs`. I’ll claim that file first, review all labels against the verb-first Title Case rules, then patch and run `cargo check` plus `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

// The actions system is **intentionally decoupled** from the standard selection callbacks:
//
// - **on_select callback is bypassed by design** for keyboard navigation
// - Actions route through `handle_action()` in the main app via keyboard events
// - This enables consistent keyboard-driven action execution across all contexts
//
// ## Key Types
//
// - [`Action`]: Represents a single action item with id, title, category, and optional shortcut
// - [`ActionCategory`]: Categorizes actions (ScriptContext, ScriptOps, GlobalOps)
// - [`ScriptInfo`]: Context about the focused script/item for building context-specific actions
//
// ## Action ID Conventions

**Adding pre-edit commentary update**
codex
I’ve identified concrete edits: normalize the primary `run_script` label to a concise verb title, and rename non-standard labels (`View/Reveal/Deeplink` and destructive removes) to consistent verb-first Title Case. I’ll patch `script_context.rs` now and add focused unit tests for the updated labels.

**Preparing test helper import and formatting checks**
codex
I’ve patched `script_context.rs` with verb-first label normalization and added targeted tests that assert the new label style rules. Next I’m running the required Rust verification commands (`cargo check` and `cargo clippy`) from the repo root.

**Preparing final concise summary**
codex
Implemented label-style normalization in `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs`.

**Changed file**
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:9`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:58`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:70`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:80`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:104`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:114`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:149`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:160`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:206`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:252`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:287`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:302`
- `src/actions/builders/script_context.rs:351`

**What changed**
- Primary `run_script` label now uses a concise title-cased verb (`title_case_words(...)`) instead of `"<verb> \"<name>\""`.
- Updated labels to consistent verb-first Title Case:
  - `Edit Keyboard Shortcut`
  - `Delete Keyboard Shortcut`
  - `Edit Alias`
  - `Delete Alias`
  - `Show Logs`
  - `Open in Finder`
  - `Copy Deep Link`
  - `Delete Ranking Entry`
- Added/updated unit tests in the same file to validate:
  - verb title-casing for run label
  - label style consistency
  - no trailing `...`
  - label length `< 30`

**Verification run**
- `cargo check -p script-kit-gpui` (failed due unrelated workspace issues, e.g. `clipboard_history` missing fields and non-exhaustive matches).
- `cargo clippy -p script-kit-gpui --all-targets -- -D warnings` (failed due unrelated existing workspace issues, including duplicate test module files and many pre-existing warnings/errors under `-D warnings`).
- `cargo test -p script-kit-gpui test_get_script_context_actions_labels_use_consistent_verb_style --lib` (failed before reaching target test because of unrelated workspace compile errors).

**How to test (once workspace is green)**
1. `cargo check -p script-kit-gpui`
2. `cargo clippy -p script-kit-gpui --all-targets -- -D warnings`
3. `cargo test -p script-kit-gpui test_get_script_context_actions_labels_use_consistent_verb_style --lib`
4. `cargo test -p script-kit-gpui test_get_script_context_actions_run_label_uses_title_case_verb --lib`

**Risks / known gaps**
- Workspace is currently broken by unrelated compile errors, so full verification could not complete to green.
- `run_script` label no longer includes the script name; any tests or UI expectations that depended on that exact title text may need updates.
