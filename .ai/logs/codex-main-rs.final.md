I need direction before proceeding: another agent committed unexpectedly while I was working, and that commit (`ddd673f`) includes my `src/main.rs` split files alongside `src/ai/window/*`. Per repo rules I should stop when this happens.

Do you want me to:
1. Treat `ddd673f` as the delivered `main` split and only do verification/reporting, or
2. Create a follow-up commit on top for the remaining local `src/main.rs` whitespace diff?
