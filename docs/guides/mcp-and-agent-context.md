# MCP and Agent Context

Script Kit GPUI uses MCP in both directions: the running app **is** an MCP server that external agents can read and control, and scripts/Agent Chat can **call** MCP servers you configure.

## Script Kit as an MCP Server

While the app runs, it serves HTTP MCP on `localhost:43210`:

- **Auth** — bearer token stored at `~/.scriptkit/agent-token` (generated on first run).
- **Discovery** — the app writes `~/.scriptkit/server.json` with the live `url`, `token`, version, and capabilities. Always re-read it instead of hard-coding values; it can be removed or rotated when the app stops.
- **Health** — `GET /health` returns `{"status":"healthy"}` without auth.
- **JSON-RPC** — clients use the `/rpc` endpoint (the `.url` in `server.json` is the base URL; append `/rpc`).

```bash
SERVER_JSON="$HOME/.scriptkit/server.json"
jq -e '.url and .token and (.capabilities.tools == true)' "$SERVER_JSON"
curl -fsS "$(jq -r '.url' "$SERVER_JSON" | sed 's:/$::')/health"
```

Treat `server.json` and `agent-token` as sensitive — never paste them into issues, logs, or committed config.

To register the live app with Codex, follow [Codex MCP Setup](../codex-mcp-setup.md).

## `kit://` Resources

External agents read structured, schema-versioned app state:

| Resource | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `kit://context` | AI-relevant desktop snapshot (selected text, frontmost app, menu bar, browser URL, focused window). Supports `?profile=minimal`, `?diagnostics=1`, and per-field flags |
| `kit://context/schema` | Self-describing schema for the context resource |
| `kit://state` | App state for safe setup/proof checks |
| `kit://scripts`, `kit://scriptlets` | Discovered script/scriptlet metadata |
| `kit://sdk-reference` | The SDK function reference (same data as the in-app SDK Reference) |
| `kit://script-templates` | Starter templates shared with the launcher |
| `kit://failed-scripts` | Scripts that failed validation |
| `kit://notes` | Notes list; `?tag=...`, `&full=true`, or `kit://notes/{id}` |
| `kit://brain` | Local memory: `kit://brain/recall?q=...`, `/doc`, `/docs`, `/signals` |
| `kit://clipboard-history` | Newest clipboard entries (`?id=`, `?limit=`) |
| `kit://dictation`, `kit://dictation-history` | Latest dictation and saved transcripts (`?id=`) |
| `kit://focused-item` | Active surface selection/focus metadata |
| `kit://computer-use/readiness` | Computer-use permission/readiness receipt |
| `kit://git-status`, `kit://git-diff`, `kit://processes`, `kit://system` | Environment snapshots |
| `kit://audit` | Recent MCP mutation audit events |

## Tools

Read tools like `kit/state` are always safe. Mutation tools (`kit/show`, `kit/hide`, `kit/trigger_builtin`, `kit/notes_create`, `kit/scripts_run`, `kit/clipboard_pin`, `kit/config_set`, ...) return structured JSON and are audited to an `mcp-audit.jsonl` file under `~/.scriptkit/`. Destructive tools require explicit confirmation, and token scopes can narrow access by domain (`notes:write`, `scripts:run`, `config:write`, ...).

Computer-use observation tools (`computer/list_native_windows`, `computer/capture_native_window`, `computer/see`, ...) are covered in [Computer Use](./computer-use.md).

## CLI Access

The app maintains a command shim at `~/.scriptkit/bin/scriptkit` that reads `server.json` for you:

```bash
~/.scriptkit/bin/scriptkit mcp tools
~/.scriptkit/bin/scriptkit mcp resources
~/.scriptkit/bin/scriptkit mcp read kit://state
~/.scriptkit/bin/scriptkit mcp call kit/trigger_builtin '{"builtinId":"builtin/clipboard-history"}'
```

It requires the app to be running and also accepts `SCRIPT_KIT_MCP_ENDPOINT` / `SCRIPT_KIT_MCP_TOKEN` overrides.

## External MCP Servers (Script Kit as a Client)

Define servers in `~/.scriptkit/config.ts` under `mcp.servers` — `transport` selects stdio or HTTP:

```typescript
export default {
  mcp: {
    enabled: true,
    servers: {
      localTools: {
        transport: "stdio",
        command: "my-mcp-server",
        args: [],
        env: {},
      },
      remoteTools: {
        transport: "http",
        endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/rpc",
        headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.MY_MCP_TOKEN ?? ""}` },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Then call them from scripts with the SDK's `mcp.*` helpers:

```typescript
import "@scriptkit/sdk";

const tools = await mcp.listTools();          // across configured servers
const matches = await mcp.discover("calendar");
const result = await mcp.call("localTools", "create_event", { title: "Standup" });
```

## Agent Chat Context

Agent Chat (double-tap the main hotkey, or `⌘⇧Space`) stages context for the active profile:

- **`@` mentions** — in the main input or the chat composer, `@selection`, `@clipboard`, `@file:readme`, `@notes:...`, `@dictation:...` attach specific context parts. See [Main Menu Input](./main-menu-input.md).
- **Add to AI** — surfaces like clipboard history and file search have "Attach to Agent Chat" actions (`⌃⌘A` in clipboard history).
- Context resolution is tolerant: if one part fails (e.g. no browser detected), the rest still submit and the failure is recorded in a resolution receipt.

## Best Practices

- Re-read `~/.scriptkit/server.json` after every app restart.
- Prefer `kit://context?profile=minimal` unless the agent needs more; use `?diagnostics=1` to debug missing fields.
- Use resources for read-only context; use tools only when an action is required.
- In scripts, call `mcp.discover(query)` before hard-coding tool names if the server set is user-configurable.
