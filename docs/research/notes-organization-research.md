# Notes Organization Research
Date: 2026-02-01

Scope: How major notes apps organize many notes, with emphasis on tags/labels, folders/notebooks, search, filtering, and quick organization patterns. Sources include Apple Notes, Google Keep, Evernote, OneNote, and Notion documentation. citeturn7view0turn13view0turn9view2turn15view0turn10view0turn8view6turn8view11

## Patterns Observed

### 1) Tags/labels (many-to-many)
- Inline tagging for fast capture: Apple Notes lets users create tags by typing `#` inside a note, including multi‑word tags; Google Keep allows labels via `#hashtags`. citeturn7view0turn12view0
- Tags/labels enable cross‑cutting organization: Apple Notes exposes tags in a dedicated Tags section for viewing all notes with a tag; Evernote describes tags as flexible keywords for organizing notes; OneNote provides a “Find Tags” view that gathers tagged notes into a summary. citeturn7view0turn9view2turn8view6
- Tag‑based auto‑collections: Apple Notes Smart Folders automatically organize and add notes based on selected tags. citeturn7view0

### 2) Folders / notebooks / stacks (hierarchical)
- Folder hierarchies: Apple Notes supports subfolders (drag a folder into another to create a subfolder). citeturn13view0
- Notebook containers and higher‑level grouping: Evernote positions notebooks as topical containers for notes and supports “notebook stacks” to group multiple notebooks. citeturn15view0

### 3) Search & tag discovery
- Tag search / summaries: OneNote’s “Find Tags” assembles tagged notes into a summary page for review. citeturn8view6
- Collection‑level search: Notion provides search inside databases to find content across entries. citeturn8view11

### 4) Filtering, sorting, and saved views
- Multi‑criteria filtering: Evernote filters by created/updated date, reminder date, tags, text contains, note type, source, location, and attachments. citeturn9view1
- Filters + sorts + groups as first‑class views: Notion supports filters, sorts, groups, and different views to slice a database. citeturn8view11
- Tag‑driven saved collections: Apple Notes Smart Folders act as saved, automatic collections based on tags. citeturn7view0
- Built‑in sorting controls: Apple Notes provides note sorting options in the UI. citeturn14view0

### 5) Quick triage signals (lightweight organization)
- “Pin” and color for rapid prioritization/visual grouping: Google Keep allows pinning notes to the top and color‑coding notes; labels can also be applied from the note actions menu. citeturn10view0

## Synthesis (Inference from Sources)
- Combining hierarchical containers (folders/notebooks) with tags/labels supports both “place‑based” and “attribute‑based” organization styles (inferred from Apple Notes and Evernote offering both structures). citeturn13view0turn7view0turn15view0turn9view2
- Low‑friction, inline tagging suggests that quick‑add tag affordances are important for capture‑first workflows (inferred from `#` tagging in Apple Notes and Google Keep). citeturn7view0turn12view0
- Saved views/smart folders reduce manual upkeep by continuously aggregating notes based on metadata (inferred from Apple Smart Folders and Notion’s view system). citeturn7view0turn8view11
