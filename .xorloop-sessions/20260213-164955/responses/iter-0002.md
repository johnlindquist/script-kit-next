## Oracle Analysis Results: Error Handling Audit

Oracle (GPT-5.2 Pro, extended thinking, 18 minutes) found **3 new issues** beyond the already-identified secrets module `.expect()` calls:

---

### Task 1: `confirm-window-safety`

**Scope:** `src/confirm/window.rs`

**Severity: HIGH (panic) + MEDIUM (swallowed errors)**

- **`.expect()` on dialog entity** (~line 215): `dialog_entity_holder.expect("Dialog entity should have been created")` — should use `.context()?` to propagate instead of panicking
- **Two swallowed mutex locks**: `if let Ok(mut guard) = window_storage.lock()` silently drops poisoned-mutex errors for `CONFIRM_WINDOW` and `CONFIRM_DIALOG`, causing state desync where the window handle never gets stored and later close calls fail

---

### Task 2: `hotkeys-init-safety`

**Scope:** `src/hotkeys/mod.rs`

**Severity: LOW (forbidden `.unwrap()`, latent panic)**

- **`.unwrap()` on OnceLock getter** (~line 905): `MAIN_MANAGER.get().unwrap().lock()` — logically safe today (immediately after `set()`), but violates the rule and becomes a panic point if refactored. Should use `match MAIN_MANAGER.get() { Some(m) => m, None => { log + return } }`

---

### Task 3: `logging-fallback-safety`

**Scope:** `src/logging/mod.rs`

**Severity: HIGH (can panic in production)**

- **Two `.expect("Failed to open /dev/null")`** in logging init fallback (~lines 684-705): When log file open fails, falls back to `/dev/null` with `.expect()`. Panics if `/dev/null` is unavailable (sandboxed environments). Fix: use `std::io::sink()` as the fallback, which is cross-platform and cannot fail.

---

**NEXT_AREA:** Audit config/data loaders (`src/quicklinks/mod.rs`, note storage paths) for "return empty/default" behavior on IO/serde failures without logging — those patterns hide real user-facing bugs.

Want me to proceed with implementing these fixes, or would you like to dispatch them to a codex-swarm?
