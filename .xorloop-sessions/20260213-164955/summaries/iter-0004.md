Looking at the Oracle analysis, here are the extracted swarm tasks:

- `submit-callback-helper` scope:`src/prompt_handler/mod.rs` — Extract shared submit callback closure used by 7 identical prompt handlers
- `window-prep-dedup` scope:`src/prompt_handler/mod.rs` — Extract window reset + visibility check block from 3 prompt handlers
- `sdk-actions-shortcuts-helper` scope:`src/prompt_handler/mod.rs` — Extract SDK actions + shortcut registry rebuild from ShowArg and SetActions

NEXT_AREA: Standardize `try_send` error handling across state/layout/ai/chat/confirm behind a single `send_response_or_log()` helper

Want me to dispatch these to a codex-swarm, or implement them sequentially?
