Looking at this, I'll extract the swarm tasks in the requested format:

- `on-close-callback-factory` scope:`src/app_impl/actions_toggle.rs` — Extract identical set_on_close callback into shared factory method
- `spawn-open-actions-window` scope:`src/app_impl/actions_toggle.rs` — Extract spawn/open_actions_window block into shared helper
- `actions-popup-preamble` scope:`src/app_impl/actions_toggle.rs` — Extract 4-line popup open preamble into begin helper method

NEXT_AREA: ActionsWindow auto-close `focus_lost` path vs `on_close` callback ordering — race between `platform::activate_main_window()` and focus restoration on popup dismiss.

Want me to dispatch these to a codex-swarm, or implement them sequentially?
