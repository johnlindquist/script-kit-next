Here's the summary:

## Results

**Task 1: `scriptlet-result-from-output`** — Already done. `ScriptletResult::from_output()` already exists at line 70 and is used at all 8 call sites. No work needed.

**Task 2: `centralize-truncate-str-chars`** — Completed. Removed 4 local copies and replaced with `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars`:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/designs/compact.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/designs/core/parts.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/fallbacks/builtins.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/prompts/chat/render_turns.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |

Files already using the canonical version (unchanged): `executor/errors.rs`, `render_script_list/mod.rs`, `prompt_handler/mod.rs`.

**Verification**: `cargo check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` pass clean. Test compilation has pre-existing errors in unrelated modules (scripts/search, actions/builders_tests, etc.).

**NEXT_AREA**: Audit Windows/Linux command execution paths in `src/executor/scriptlet.rs` (notably `execute_open`/shell tool handling) for correctness and parity with `OpenBrowser` in `src/prompt_handler/mod.rs`.

Do NOT repeat items already covered above. Find something new.
## Target Code

This is a clear finding. `secrets_path()` (line 117) uses `.expect()` and it's called from `load_secrets_from_disk()` (line 140) and `save_secrets()` (line 226), which feed into every public API: `get_secret()`, `get_secret_info()`, `set_secret()`, `delete_secret()`, `has_secret()`, `list_secret_keys()`, and `warmup_cache()`. Three `.expect()` calls in production code that will panic instead of returning errors.

FEATURE: Secrets module uses `.expect()` for mutex lock and home directory resolution, which will panic in production instead of gracefully handling errors when the mutex is poisoned or `$HOME` is unset.
FILES: src/secrets.rs, src/list_item/mod.rs
SMELL: `secrets_path()` calls `dirs::home_dir().expect(...)` (line 117) and `get_cached_secrets()`/`update_cache()` call `.lock().expect(...)` (lines 77, 90) — three production panics in code that should propagate errors via `Result`, violating the project's "no unwrap/expect in production" rule.

## Task: error handling fix: find missing guards, unchecked returns, brittle parsing, swallowed errors — write the corrected code with proper error handling

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
