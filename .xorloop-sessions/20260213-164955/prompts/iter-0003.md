Here's the summary:

## Results

**Task 1: `scriptlet-result-from-output`** — Already done. `ScriptletResult::from_output()` already exists at line 70 and is used at all 8 call sites. No work needed.

**Task 2: `centralize-truncate-str-chars`** — Completed. Removed 4 local copies and replaced with `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars`:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/designs/compact.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/designs/core/parts.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/fallbacks/builtins.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |
| `src/prompts/chat/render_turns.rs` | Removed local fn, added `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` |

Files already using the canonical version (unchanged): `executor/errors.rs`, `render_script_list/mod.rs`, `prompt_handler/mod.rs`.

**Verification**: `cargo check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` pass clean. Test compilation has pre-existing errors in unrelated modules (scripts/search, actions/builders_tests, etc.).

**NEXT_AREA**: Audit Windows/Linux command execution paths in `src/executor/scriptlet.rs` (notably `execute_open`/shell tool handling) for correctness and parity with `OpenBrowser` in `src/prompt_handler/mod.rs`.

Looking at these 3 tasks, here's the extracted swarm task list:

1. `confirm-window-safety` scope:`src/confirm/window.rs` — Replace `.expect()` with `?` and log poisoned-mutex errors instead of swallowing
2. `hotkeys-init-safety` scope:`src/hotkeys/mod.rs` — Replace `.unwrap()` on OnceLock getter with match/guard pattern
3. `logging-fallback-safety` scope:`src/logging/mod.rs` — Replace `.expect()` on `/dev/null` open with `std::io::sink()` fallback

NEXT_AREA: config/data loaders (`src/quicklinks/mod.rs`, note storage paths) — silent "return empty/default" on IO/serde failures without logging

Want me to implement these fixes?

Do NOT repeat items already covered above. Find something new.
## Target Code

FEATURE: `execute_script()` and `execute_script_interactive()` in the script runner implement the same runtime-fallback chain (bun+preload → bun → node) with near-identical try/match/log blocks copy-pasted for two different execution modes
FILES: src/executor/runner.rs
SMELL: Lines 575-669 and 752-881 duplicate the same cascading runtime-fallback pattern 6+ times, each with identical logging/tracing boilerplate differing only in whether they call `spawn_script` vs `run_command`, making it error-prone to add a new runtime or change fallback order

## Task: simplify and refactor: find over-engineered patterns, unnecessary abstractions, overly complex logic — write the simplified replacement

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
