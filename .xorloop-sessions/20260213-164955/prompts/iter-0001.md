## Target Code

FEATURE: Scriptlet executor functions each build a `ScriptletResult` from `std::process::Output` with identical 4-line conversion boilerplate repeated 8+ times across `execute_shell_scriptlet`, `execute_with_interpreter`, `execute_applescript`, `execute_typescript`, `execute_open`, `execute_edit`, `execute_type`, and `execute_submit`
FILES: src/executor/scriptlet.rs, src/executor/errors.rs, src/prompt_handler/mod.rs, src/render_script_list/mod.rs
SMELL: The identical `ScriptletResult { exit_code: output.status.code().unwrap_or(-1), stdout: String::from_utf8_lossy(...), ... }` block is copy-pasted 8 times in scriptlet.rs instead of extracting a single `ScriptletResult::from_output(output)` constructor, and `truncate_str_chars` is duplicated across 3 separate modules

## Task: simplify and refactor: find over-engineered patterns, unnecessary abstractions, overly complex logic — write the simplified replacement

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
