- The emoji picker's core navigation/scroll logic relies on undocumented invariants (category contiguity, flat-index model, row mapping) shared between `compute_scroll_row` and the grid renderer — the highest-priority gap.
- Public types (`Emoji`, `EmojiCategory`, `ALL_CATEGORIES`, `EMOJIS`) and helpers (`search_emojis`, `grouped_emojis`) lack rustdoc, module-level docs, and ordering/search-semantics documentation.
- The render function (`render_emoji_picker`) has no section comments or module docs despite being ~500 lines, and there's no standalone architecture doc for the emoji subsystem.

- **Unbounded timer spawning:** Every arrow key press spawns a new detached 1s timer task with no dedup guard, creating a "thundering herd" of tasks during rapid input — fix with a single debounced fade task pattern.

- **Redundant work per keystroke:** Double `cx.notify()` calls per navigation event cause extra render invalidations, and repeated linear scans over `grouped_items` (`.position()` + `.rposition()`) compound to O(n²) during sustained key holds.

- **Missing fast-path guards:** Cursor-hide platform calls fire unconditionally every keystroke even when already in keyboard mode, and `validate_selection_bounds()` does multiple full passes plus eager cache clearing regardless of whether selection actually changed.

- **Critical gaps**: Architecture docs in `keyword_manager` describe outdated stop/restart behavior; keystroke logger captures passwords with no privacy warning; keyword expansion silently falls back on unknown tool types without documentation.

- **Major gaps**: Timing constants reference nonexistent logic, keystroke filtering/variable substitution/matching semantics are undocumented, `scriptlet_path` field is misleading (accepts synthetic IDs), and no authoring guide exists for keyword triggers.

- **Minor gaps**: Stale inline comments in scriptlet parsing don't match actual checks, and non-macOS stub functions lack rustdoc explaining their no-op behavior.

## Feature Under Review

FEATURE: Window tiling and management system using macOS Accessibility APIs (AXUIElement) to list, move, resize, tile (halves/quadrants/thirds/sixths), minimize, maximize, close, and focus windows across applications and displays.
FILES: src/window_control/mod.rs, src/actions/dialog.rs, src/platform/mod.rs

## Analysis Category

performance: look for O(n^2), repeated I/O, unbounded loops, heavy regex, unnecessary allocations

## Instructions

1. Analyze the feature described above through the lens of: performance
2. Be specific: reference actual file paths, function names, line ranges
3. Output a prioritized checklist of actionable improvements
4. For each item: severity (critical/major/minor), file path, concrete fix description
5. End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
