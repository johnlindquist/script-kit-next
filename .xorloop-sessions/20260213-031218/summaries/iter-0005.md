- **Full AX crawl on every cache miss**: Each window operation triggers a complete enumeration of all apps and windows on miss, with cache-clearing causing thrash — the single biggest bottleneck at O(apps × windows) per operation.
- **Redundant per-call allocations**: CFString attribute names are re-created for every AX call, window titles allocate fresh buffers in hot loops, and the cache locks/unlocks per insertion instead of batching — all adding unnecessary overhead.
- **Synchronous AX on the UI thread**: All accessibility calls are cross-process and blocking; if invoked from GPUI action handlers they stall rendering, and display bounds are also re-queried on every operation instead of being cached.

NEXT_SEED: AXUIElement lifetime safety — stale window IDs, CF retain/release ownership across cache refreshes, and cache invalidation correctness
