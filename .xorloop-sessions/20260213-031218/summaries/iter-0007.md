- GPT-5.2 Pro found 16 documentation gaps in the emoji picker and related modules: 7 major (missing rustdoc on public structs/enums/functions, undocumented invariants in `compute_scroll_row`, misleading API names) and 7 minor (undocumented constants, search semantics, placeholder stubs).
- The most impactful gaps are in `emoji/mod.rs` (no module docs, undocumented `Emoji` struct and ordering invariant), `emoji_picker.rs` (no top-level doc for the core render function), and `prompt_footer.rs` (misleading `from_design()` that ignores its parameter, hidden magic strings suppressing rendering).
- Public API surface in `builtins/mod.rs` (`BuiltInFeature`, `BuiltInEntry`, `get_builtin_entries()`) and `app_view_state.rs` (`InputMode` enum) lack any rustdoc, making the built-in command lifecycle and input mode contract opaque to contributors.
