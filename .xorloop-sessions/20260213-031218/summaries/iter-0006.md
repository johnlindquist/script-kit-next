- **Unbounded search input (MAJOR):** Pasting multi-MB text into the emoji filter triggers expensive string clones on the UI thread, causing a DoS. Fix by clamping input to 512 bytes (UTF-8-safe) before processing.
- **Minor defensive gaps (3 findings):** No bidi/control char validation on clipboard output, emoji picker unconditionally registered (can't be disabled via config), and a fragile slice index that could panic if invariants break.
- **Clean baseline:** No `unsafe` blocks, no deserialization or file handling, and no secret leaks found in the emoji picker path — the codebase is structurally sound here.

NEXT_SEED: Clipboard integration layer (`cx.write_to_clipboard` / macOS `NSPasteboard` types) — verify plain UTF-8 only, no extra pasteboard flavors enabling injection or data leakage.
