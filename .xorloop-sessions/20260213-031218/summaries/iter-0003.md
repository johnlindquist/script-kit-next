- **Unbounded timer spawning:** Every arrow key press spawns a new detached 1s timer task with no dedup guard, creating a "thundering herd" of tasks during rapid input — fix with a single debounced fade task pattern.

- **Redundant work per keystroke:** Double `cx.notify()` calls per navigation event cause extra render invalidations, and repeated linear scans over `grouped_items` (`.position()` + `.rposition()`) compound to O(n²) during sustained key holds.

- **Missing fast-path guards:** Cursor-hide platform calls fire unconditionally every keystroke even when already in keyboard mode, and `validate_selection_bounds()` does multiple full passes plus eager cache clearing regardless of whether selection actually changed.
