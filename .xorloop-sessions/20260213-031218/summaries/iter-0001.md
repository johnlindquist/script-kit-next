- **Critical: Excessive FFI allocations in hot paths** — Every AX attribute read creates throwaway CString/CFString objects; constant attribute names are never cached; and multiple separate cross-process AX calls per menu item should be batched with `AXUIElementCopyMultipleAttributeValues`.

- **Major: Cloning, locking, and concurrency waste** — Full menu tree deep-cloned on every read (use `Arc`); SQLite mutex held during serde; rapid app-switching spawns unbounded OS threads for AX scans (need debounce + single worker); linear string-allocating scans for menu item lookup.

- **Minor: Small allocation and timing inefficiencies** — Hard-coded 50ms sleeps instead of bounded polling; missing `Vec::with_capacity` hints; unconditional logging and redundant attribute fetches in separator detection that compound after the critical fixes land.

NEXT_SEED: Menu item search/indexing layer — how the parsed AX tree is queried for user commands and whether it introduces O(n^2) behavior.
