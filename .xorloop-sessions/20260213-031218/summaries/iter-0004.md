- **Critical gaps**: Architecture docs in `keyword_manager` describe outdated stop/restart behavior; keystroke logger captures passwords with no privacy warning; keyword expansion silently falls back on unknown tool types without documentation.

- **Major gaps**: Timing constants reference nonexistent logic, keystroke filtering/variable substitution/matching semantics are undocumented, `scriptlet_path` field is misleading (accepts synthetic IDs), and no authoring guide exists for keyword triggers.

- **Minor gaps**: Stale inline comments in scriptlet parsing don't match actual checks, and non-macOS stub functions lack rustdoc explaining their no-op behavior.
