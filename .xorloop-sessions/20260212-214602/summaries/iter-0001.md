- **Unbounded deserialization & unsafe file writes**: The frecency store lacks size limits on JSON loading (DoS risk), uses predictable temp paths without fsync (data corruption/symlink attacks), and creates files world-readable while logging sensitive filter text verbatim.
- **NaN propagation & ranking manipulation**: Half-life calculations don't guard against NaN, and loaded JSON is fully trusted — future timestamps prevent decay (permanent top rank), oversized keys bloat memory, and the filtering cache ignores frecency revision changes.
- **Information leakage via logs**: Both filter text (which may contain pasted tokens/passwords) and full script paths (which may reveal project/client names) are logged verbatim; frecency file permissions default to 0644 instead of 0600.
