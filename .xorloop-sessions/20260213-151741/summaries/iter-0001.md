Looking at this analysis, here are the extracted swarm tasks:

- `watcher-core` scope:`src/watcher/{mod.rs,generic.rs}` — Create shared generic Watcher engine with WatcherSpec/EventSink traits and fix Drop stop-signal bug
- `config-theme-migration` scope:`src/watcher/specs/*.rs` — Migrate ConfigWatcher and ThemeWatcher to SingleFileReloadSpec over generic
- `script-migration` scope:`src/watcher/specs/script.rs` — Migrate ScriptWatcher to generic, fix discover_kit_watch_paths running only once
- `app-migration` scope:`src/watcher/specs/app.rs` — Migrate AppWatcher to generic, fix missing ~/Applications dir at startup

NEXT_AREA: Restart correctness — what state must be recomputed per supervisor attempt, and which directories/files can be permanently missed if created while a watcher is down.
