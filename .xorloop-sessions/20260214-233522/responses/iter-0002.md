## Oracle Analysis Summary

GPT-5.2 Pro (extended thinking, 8m29s) audited 21 theme files. After cross-referencing with grep across the full `src/` tree, I filtered out several false positives (Oracle incorrectly flagged `PromptColors`, `InputFieldColors`, `hover_overlay_bg`, preset functions, `with_opacity_offset`, `ColorResolver`, and `ThemeService` as dead — all have production callers). 

Here are the **verified** dead code items grouped into 4 tasks:

### Task 1: `rm-background-role-dead-code`

**Scope:** `src/theme/types.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/theme/types.rs`, the `BackgroundRole` enum (lines 1030-1041), the `hex_to_rgba_components()` function (lines 1044-1049), and three `Theme` methods — `background_rgba()` (lines 1204-1220), `get_opacity_for_focus()` (lines 1137-1161) — are all gated behind `#[allow(dead_code)]` and have zero production callers. `BackgroundRole` is only used by `background_rgba()`, which is only called from tests. `hex_to_rgba_components()` is only called by `background_rgba()`. `get_opacity_for_focus()` is only called by `background_rgba()` and tests. Also delete `DropShadow::clamped()` (line 332-337, the `#[allow(dead_code)]` method on `DropShadow`) and `TerminalColors::get()` (lines 596-618, the `#[allow(dead_code)]` method on `TerminalColors`). Finally, delete `invalidate_theme_cache()` (line 1584) which is defined but has zero callers anywhere in the codebase.

Delete all of the above items: `BackgroundRole` enum, `hex_to_rgba_components()` fn, `Theme::background_rgba()`, `Theme::get_opacity_for_focus()`, `DropShadow::clamped()`, `TerminalColors::get()`, and `invalidate_theme_cache()`. Remove any doc comments associated with them. In `src/theme/mod.rs` line 61, remove `invalidate_theme_cache` from the `pub use types::` re-export. In `src/theme/mod.rs` lines 73-78, remove `BackgroundRole` from the `#[cfg(test)] pub use types::` re-export. In `src/theme/prelude.rs` line 11, remove `invalidate_theme_cache` from the import.

Do NOT delete: `Theme::get_colors()`, `Theme::get_cursor_style()`, `Theme::with_opacity_offset()`, `Theme::get_opacity()`, `Theme::get_drop_shadow()`, `Theme::get_vibrancy()`, `Theme::is_vibrancy_enabled()`, `Theme::get_fonts()`, `BackgroundOpacity::clamped()` (line 169, no `#[allow(dead_code)]`). The `#[allow(dead_code)]` on the `impl Theme` block (line 1051) should be kept since it covers other live methods. After deletion, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` to verify.

### Task 2: `rm-dead-test-helpers`

**Scope:** `src/theme/tests/helpers.rs, src/theme/tests/core.rs, src/theme/theme_tests/mod.rs`

**Task:**
After Task 1 removes `BackgroundRole`, `background_rgba`, and `get_opacity_for_focus` from `types.rs`, the tests referencing them will fail to compile. In `src/theme/tests/helpers.rs`, delete the entire section starting around line 95 with comment `// BackgroundRole and background_rgba API Tests` through the end of the `background_rgba` test functions (approximately lines 95-137). In `src/theme/tests/core.rs`, delete the test `test_get_opacity_for_focus_keeps_selection_and_hover_strength_when_unfocused` (around lines 139-145) and the `DropShadow::clamped()` tests (around lines 328+). In `src/theme/theme_tests/mod.rs`, delete `test_get_opacity_for_focus_keeps_selection_and_hover_strength_when_unfocused` (around lines 142-145), the `// BackgroundRole and background_rgba API Tests` section (around lines 428-466), and `DropShadow::clamped()` tests (around lines 331-347).

Remove all test functions that reference `BackgroundRole`, `background_rgba`, `get_opacity_for_focus`, `DropShadow::clamped()`, or `TerminalColors::get()`. Remove any `use super::types::BackgroundRole` imports in these test files. Do NOT delete any other tests — only the ones that reference the deleted production code. After deletion, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

### Task 3: `rm-semantic-module`

**Scope:** `src/theme/semantic.rs, src/theme/mod.rs, src/theme/prelude.rs`

**Task:**
The entire `src/theme/semantic.rs` module (507 lines) is dead code. It defines `FocusAware<T>`, `SemanticColors`, `Surface`, `SurfaceStyle` with a module-level `#![allow(dead_code)]` and the comment "designed for incremental adoption." Grep confirms these types have zero production callers — they are only re-exported in `mod.rs` and `prelude.rs` and tested within `semantic.rs` itself. No file outside the theme module imports or uses `SemanticColors`, `FocusAware`, `Surface`, or `SurfaceStyle`.

Delete `src/theme/semantic.rs` entirely. In `src/theme/mod.rs`, remove `pub mod semantic;` (line 26) and remove the re-export block `pub use semantic::{FocusAware, SemanticColors, Surface, SurfaceStyle};` (line 46). In `src/theme/prelude.rs`, remove the re-export `pub use super::semantic::{FocusAware, SemanticColors, Surface, SurfaceStyle};` (line 9). Note: `Surface` appears in `src/designs/separator_variations/` but that's a completely different type (`SeparatorColorRole::UiSurface`) — not the same type from `semantic.rs`.

Do NOT touch `src/theme/validation.rs` — while it has similar "only used in tests" characteristics, it's a useful development tool for validating theme JSON files and should be kept. After deletion, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

### Task 4: `rm-hex-option-serde`

**Scope:** `src/theme/hex_color.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/theme/hex_color.rs`, the `hex_color_option_serde` module (starting at line 130) defines `serialize` and `deserialize` functions for `Option<HexColor>` serde support. Both functions are marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Grep confirms the module name `hex_color_option_serde` appears only at its definition — zero `#[serde(with = "hex_color_option_serde")]` attributes exist anywhere in the codebase. The module is truly unreferenced dead code.

Delete the entire `pub mod hex_color_option_serde { ... }` block from `src/theme/hex_color.rs`. This starts at line 130 and goes to the end of the module block. No re-exports of this module exist in `mod.rs` or `prelude.rs`, so no other files need changes. After deletion, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

NEXT_AREA: `src/theme/service.rs` — the theme service has `#![allow(dead_code)]` at module level but IS used in production (`ensure_theme_service` called from `main_entry/`). The allow attribute is stale and should be investigated — other items in that module may be truly dead while the service init path is live.
