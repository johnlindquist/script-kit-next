Oracle returned 4 well-structured swarm tasks. Here's the summary:

---

### Task 1: `theme-validation-known-keys`

**Scope:** `src/theme/validation*.rs`

**Task:** `src/theme/validation.rs` emits spurious "Unknown key ... will be ignored" warnings for valid theme JSON because the hardcoded allow-lists are stale. `KNOWN_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` (line 168) is missing `"appearance"` (the `Theme` struct has `pub appearance: AppearanceMode`). `KNOWN_TEXT_KEYS` (line 178) is missing `"on_accent"` (the `TextColors` struct has `pub on_accent: HexColor`). Add the missing keys and add regression tests in `validation_tests.rs`.

---

### Task 2: `theme-service-polling-constants`

**Scope:** `src/theme/service.rs`

**Task:** Magic numbers `200`, `500`, `2000` (ms) and idle thresholds `5`, `10` control polling backoff but are unnamed. Extract to `const FAST_POLL_MS: u64 = 200`, `MEDIUM_POLL_MS`, `SLOW_POLL_MS`, `FAST_POLL_IDLE_CUTOFF`, `MEDIUM_POLL_IDLE_CUTOFF` — preserving exact behavior.

---

### Task 3: `terminal-theme-adapter-default-palette-constants`

**Scope:** `src/terminal/theme_adapter*.rs`

**Task:** Dozens of `hex_to_rgb(0x...)` calls for ANSI palette + default fg/bg/cursor/selection colors. Extract to named `pub(super) const` values so intent is clear and palette changes are centralized. Don't break `ThemeAdapter::from_theme()`.

---

### Task 4: `icons-render-color-tokens-or-constants`

**Scope:** `src/icons/render.rs`

**Task:** Test-only `rgb(0x...)` values for icon colors at lines 219-234. Replace with named constants in the test module (`const TEST_ICON_FOREGROUND: u32 = 0xffffff`, etc.) to prevent magic-palette creep.

---

**NEXT_AREA:** `src/theme/validation.rs` — extend to validate nested keys for `colors.terminal` and `focus_aware` (including `focused/unfocused` sub-objects) so invalid terminal palettes and focus-aware theme shapes get actionable diagnostics.
