The Oracle session failed due to Chrome disconnecting, so I performed the analysis directly from the source files. Here's a summary of the 4 swarm tasks generated:

1. **`fix-text-on-accent-resolution`** (Bug) — The primary target: three locations (`helpers.rs:73`, `list_item/mod.rs:524`, `base.rs:159`) use `colors.text.primary` instead of `colors.text.on_accent`, making the dedicated theme field non-customizable. Notably, `color_resolver.rs:132` already does it correctly.

2. **`dedupe-list-item-colors`** (Cleanup) — Two different `ListItemColors` structs exist: one Rgba-based in `theme/helpers.rs` and one u32-based in `list_item/mod.rs`. Both serve the same purpose but were created by different agents. The `list_item/mod.rs` version is canonical.

3. **`unify-merged-part-comments`** (Cleanup) — Stale `// --- merged from part_XXX.rs ---` comments in `list_item/mod.rs` (4 occurrences) and `theme/types.rs` (6 occurrences) are artifacts from the banned `part_*.rs` convention.

4. **`fix-helpers-is-dark-default`** (Bug) — `PromptColors::from_color_scheme()` hardcodes `is_dark: true`, giving light-mode users dark-mode syntax highlighting.

**NEXT_AREA:** `src/designs/traits/colors.rs` — 10+ design variant color definitions from different agents, potential for missing fields and inconsistent contrast.
