All 4 tasks have **already been completed** in recent commits:

| Worker | Task | Commit |
|--------|------|--------|
| `theme-validation-known-keys` | Add `appearance` and `on_accent` to validation allow-lists | `7dd41e81` |
| `theme-service-polling-constants` | Extract polling backoff magic numbers to named constants | `3737e167` |
| `terminal-theme-adapter-default-palette-constants` | Extract terminal theme adapter color constants | `e8da494e` |
| `icons-render-color-tokens-or-constants` | Replace test-only magic `rgb(0x...)` with named constants | In working tree (`src/icons/render.rs` modified) |

The working tree has uncommitted changes from what looks like a prior xorloop session. The remaining diff touches `src/icons/render.rs` (task 4) plus some theme file cleanup (deleted `semantic.rs`, removed tests).

Would you like me to:
1. Verify the current state passes the gate (`cargo check && cargo clippy && cargo test`)?
2. Commit the remaining uncommitted work?
3. Something else?

**NEXT_AREA:** `src/theme/validation.rs` — extend validation to cover nested `colors.terminal` keys and `focus_aware` sub-objects (`focused`/`unfocused`) so invalid terminal palettes get actionable diagnostics.
