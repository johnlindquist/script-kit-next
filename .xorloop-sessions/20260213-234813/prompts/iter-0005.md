# Script Kit GPUI

Rust (GPUI app shell) + TypeScript (bun script runner) + SDK. Backwards-compatible rewrite of Script Kit.

## Scope Rules

- Do ONLY what is explicitly requested. No unrequested changes, refactors, or "improvements."
- If you notice something worth improving, mention it at the end — do not implement it.
- Stay within the boundaries of the task. A docs request is not a code change.

## Verification Gate (Mandatory)

Every code change must pass before reporting success:

```bash
cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

After the gate passes, verify the change actually works:
- **Logic changes**: check logs with `SCRIPT_KIT_AI_LOG=1`
- **UI changes**: capture screenshot AND read the PNG to confirm visually
- **Never** report success without running verification

## Build & Test

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Check | `cargo check` |
| Lint | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Test | `cargo test` |
| Test (system) | `cargo test --features system-tests` |
| Test (slow) | `cargo test --features slow-tests` |
| Run | `echo '{"type":"show"}' \| SCRIPT_KIT_AI_LOG=1 ./target/debug/script-kit-gpui 2>&1` |
| Bundle | `cargo bundle --release` |

## Coding Conventions

### Rust
- Use `?` or graceful error handling — never `unwrap()` in unsafe/ObjC code
- After any render-affecting mutation: `cx.notify()`
- Use `theme.colors.*` — never hardcode `rgb(0x...)`
- Keyboard keys — match both variants:
  ```rust
  match key.as_str() {
    "up" | "arrowup" => ...,
    "down" | "arrowdown" => ...,
    "enter" | "Enter" => ...,
    "escape" | "Escape" => ...,
    _ => {}
  }
  ```

### UI Testing
- **Never** pass scripts as CLI args — use stdin JSON protocol
- Always use `SCRIPT_KIT_AI_LOG=1` for compact log output
- After screenshots, **read the PNG file** to verify

## Architecture Quick Ref

- Built-in commands: `BuiltInFeature` enum → `get_builtin_entries()` → `execute_builtin()` → `AppView` variant → render
- Non-dismissable views: add to `is_dismissable_view()` in `app_impl.rs`
- Vibrancy: prompts should NOT set opaque bg — let vibrancy show through from Root
- Render wrappers: `render_prompts/other.rs` wraps prompt entities, `prompts/*.rs` are inner components
- Protocol: bidirectional JSONL over stdin/stdout between bun scripts and Rust app — see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`

## Consistency Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These rules exist because mixed patterns break both human navigation and AI agent effectiveness.

### 1) No `part_*.rs` files
- Do NOT create or extend `part_000.rs`, `part_001.rs`, etc.
- Do NOT use `include!("part_*.rs")` for hand-written code.
- If a module is too large, split into a directory module with named files:
  - `mod.rs` is a facade that does `mod foo; mod bar;` and `pub use ...;`
  - Filenames must be semantic (`model.rs`, `render.rs`, `storage.rs`), never numeric.

### 2) Tests have only two homes (pick the right one)
- Unit tests live next to code

These commits were ALREADY MADE — do NOT suggest changes that duplicate this work.

Here are the extracted swarm tasks:

- `ui-key-helpers` scope:`src/ui_foundation/mod.rs, src/confirm/window.rs` — Add `is_key_tab` and `is_key_space` helpers, update confirm window
- `prompts-path-template-drop-keys` scope:`src/prompts/path/render.rs, src/prompts/template/render.rs, src/prompts/drop.rs` — Convert Path, Template, Drop key matching to canonical helpers
- `prompts-select-keys` scope:`src/prompts/select/render.rs` — Replace inline key booleans with canonical helpers in select prompt
- `chat-key-actions` scope:`src/prompts/chat/types.rs` — Refactor setup card and chat input key resolution to canonical helpers

NEXT_AREA: `src/prompts/chat/render_core.rs` per-keystroke `to_ascii_lowercase()` allocation
---


Here are the extracted swarm tasks:

- `infer-type-zero-alloc` scope:`src/prompts/select/types.rs` — Eliminate ~16 heap allocations per call in `infer_script_type()` via zero-alloc `&str`-based helper
- `tests-infer-type-fragments` scope:`src/prompts/select/tests.rs` — Add regression tests for script-type inference covering ext#fragment, path, and keyword patterns

NEXT_AREA: `subtitle_text()` allocation in `ChoiceDisplayMetadata` — per-choice `String`/`Vec` allocations during rendering
---


Here are the swarm tasks:

- `rm-dead-design-renderers` scope:`src/designs/{brutalist,glassmorphism,neon_cyberpunk,material3,paper,playful,apple_hig,compact}*` — Delete 8 unused design renderer modules (~3,900 lines of dead code)
- `prune-designs-mod-rs` scope:`src/designs/mod.rs` — Remove mod/use declarations for deleted design renderers and DesignRenderer trait
- `rm-design-renderer-trait` scope:`src/designs/traits/parts.rs,src/designs/minimal.rs,src/designs/retro_terminal/parts.rs` — Delete DesignRenderer trait, its impls, and all `#![allow(dead_code)]` suppressions

NEXT_AREA: `src/designs/core/parts.rs` — `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations on helper functions may hide genuinely dead code

Want me to spawn these as a Codex swarm? Note that tasks 1 and 2 can run in parallel, but task 3 should run after both complete (it touches files that survive the deletion).

</previous-iterations>

These areas were ALREADY addressed in earlier iterations. Do NOT re-analyze them. Find something completely different.

## Target Code

FEATURE: Clipboard history DB worker silently drops all database operation results via `let _ = reply.send(...)` across 15 request handlers, meaning callers never learn about failures
FILES: src/clipboard_history/db_worker/mod.rs, src/clipboard_history/database.rs, src/clipboard_history/cache.rs
SMELL: Every DB operation result (add, remove, pin, clear, vacuum, etc.) is sent through a oneshot channel whose send error is unconditionally discarded with `let _ =`, so if the receiver is dropped the operation silently fails with no logging — and `database.rs:197` compounds this with an `.unwrap()` on `OnceLock::get()` that can panic during concurrent initialization

## Task: error handling fix: find unwrap/expect in non-test code, swallowed errors, missing ? propagation, panics that should be Results — write proper error handling

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

This is a large codebase primarily written by AI agents. Different agents made different choices, leading to inconsistencies, duplicated patterns, mixed conventions, and rough edges throughout. Your job is to find real quality issues and generate precise work orders to fix them.

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

If a CLAUDE.md or project-conventions block was provided above, the workers MUST follow those rules. Include relevant conventions in each task description.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
