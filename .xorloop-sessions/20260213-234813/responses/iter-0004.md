Good. Oracle's recommendations align with my analysis but need more detail for autonomous Codex workers. Let me synthesize the full work orders with exhaustive instructions. The key insight is that these 3 tasks have ordering dependencies — Task 3 (file deletion) depends on Task 1 (mod.rs pruning). For Codex workers running in parallel, I need to make them self-contained.

Here are the swarm tasks:

## SWARM TASK LIST

### Task 1: `rm-dead-design-renderers`

**Scope:** `src/designs/brutalist.rs, src/designs/glassmorphism.rs, src/designs/glassmorphism/parts.rs, src/designs/neon_cyberpunk.rs, src/designs/neon_cyberpunk/parts.rs, src/designs/material3.rs, src/designs/paper.rs, src/designs/playful.rs, src/designs/playful/parts.rs, src/designs/apple_hig.rs, src/designs/compact.rs`

**Task:**
Delete the 8 unused design renderer modules entirely. These files implement the `DesignRenderer` trait for Brutalist, Glassmorphism, NeonCyberpunk, Material3, Paper, Playful, AppleHIG, and Compact designs — but `render_design_item()` in `core/parts.rs` only uses `MinimalRenderer` and `RetroTerminalRenderer` directly. The 8 renderer files total ~3,900 lines of genuinely dead code, all suppressed with `#![allow(dead_code)]` file-level annotations.

Delete these files: `src/designs/brutalist.rs` (392 lines), `src/designs/glassmorphism.rs` (7 lines, a facade), `src/designs/glassmorphism/parts.rs` (538 lines), `src/designs/neon_cyberpunk.rs` (7 lines, a facade), `src/designs/neon_cyberpunk/parts.rs` (594 lines), `src/designs/material3.rs` (486 lines), `src/designs/paper.rs` (475 lines), `src/designs/playful.rs` (7 lines, a facade), `src/designs/playful/parts.rs` (565 lines), `src/designs/apple_hig.rs` (477 lines), `src/designs/compact.rs` (356 lines). After deleting the `parts.rs` files, delete the now-empty directories `src/designs/glassmorphism/`, `src/designs/neon_cyberpunk/`, `src/designs/playful/`. Do NOT delete `src/designs/minimal.rs`, `src/designs/retro_terminal.rs`, `src/designs/retro_terminal/parts.rs`, `src/designs/core/`, `src/designs/traits/`, `src/designs/icon_variations/`, `src/designs/separator_variations/`, or `src/designs/group_header_variations/`.

This task must be coordinated with `prune-designs-mod-rs` which removes the corresponding `mod` and `pub use` declarations from `mod.rs`. After both tasks complete, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` to verify.

### Task 2: `prune-designs-mod-rs`

**Scope:** `src/designs/mod.rs`

**Task:**
The file `src/designs/mod.rs` declares modules and re-exports types for all 11 design variants, but 8 of them (brutalist, glassmorphism, neon_cyberpunk, material3, paper, playful, apple_hig, compact) are being deleted. Remove their `mod` declarations and `pub use` re-exports from `mod.rs`, and also remove the `DesignRenderer`/`DesignRendererBox` re-export since the trait is being deleted.

Specifically, remove lines 1 (`#![allow(unused_imports)]`), lines 10-12 (`pub mod apple_hig`, `pub mod brutalist`, `pub mod compact`), line 13 (`mod glassmorphism`), lines 16 (`pub mod material3`), 18 (`pub mod neon_cyberpunk`), 19 (`pub mod paper`), 20 (`pub mod playful`). Remove the `pub use` blocks at lines 26-67 (the re-exports for apple_hig, brutalist, compact, glassmorphism, material3, neon_cyberpunk, paper, playful). Remove line 75 (`pub use traits::{DesignRenderer, DesignRendererBox};`). Keep: `pub mod group_header_variations` (line 14), `pub mod icon_variations` (line 15), `mod minimal` (line 17), `pub mod retro_terminal` (line 21), `pub mod separator_variations` (line 22), `mod traits` (line 23), `mod core` (line 77), `pub use core::*` (line 79), and the `pub use minimal::{...}` block (lines 48-54) and `pub use retro_terminal::{...}` block (line 68) and `pub use traits::{...}` block (lines 69-74 — the one with DesignTokens, DesignColors, etc., NOT the DesignRenderer one at line 75). The resulting `mod.rs` should be clean with no `#![allow(...)]` attributes at the top.

After editing, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`. Fix any remaining unused-import warnings by removing the unused re-exports rather than adding `allow` attributes.

### Task 3: `rm-design-renderer-trait`

**Scope:** `src/designs/traits/parts.rs, src/designs/traits.rs, src/designs/minimal.rs, src/designs/retro_terminal/parts.rs`

**Task:**
Delete the `DesignRenderer<App>` trait definition and `DesignRendererBox<App>` type alias from `src/designs/traits/parts.rs` (lines 1593-1648 approximately — the trait at line 1609 and the type alias at line 1642, plus the surrounding doc comments). Also delete all `impl DesignRenderer<App>` blocks and their `use super::{DesignRenderer, DesignVariant}` import lines from the two remaining renderer files: `src/designs/minimal.rs` (the `impl DesignRenderer<App> for MinimalRenderer` block starting around line 118, and the import of `DesignRenderer` at line 19) and `src/designs/retro_terminal/parts.rs` (the `impl<App> DesignRenderer<App> for RetroTerminalRenderer` block starting around line 234, and the import of `DesignRenderer` at line 4). Keep the `use super::DesignVariant` import in both files since `DesignVariant` is still used. Keep the `.render_item()` methods on MinimalRenderer and RetroTerminalRenderer — those are called directly from `render_design_item()`, not through the trait.

Remove `#![allow(dead_code)]` from `src/designs/traits.rs` (line 1) and `src/designs/minimal.rs` (line 1) and `src/designs/retro_terminal.rs` (line 1). In `traits.rs`, also remove `#[allow(unused_imports)]` (line 3) and the `use super::DesignVariant;` import at line 4 if it's no longer needed (check if `parts.rs` re-imports it). After removing `#![allow(dead_code)]`, any NEW dead code warnings that surface must be fixed by deleting the dead code, not by re-adding allow attributes. Run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

NEXT_AREA: `src/designs/core/parts.rs` has several `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations on helper functions (`auto_description_for_script`, `code_preview_for_scriptlet`, `extension_default_icon`) — these may also be dead or may need their allows removed to confirm they're genuinely used.
