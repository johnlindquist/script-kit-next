Here are the swarm tasks:

- `rm-dead-design-renderers` scope:`src/designs/{brutalist,glassmorphism,neon_cyberpunk,material3,paper,playful,apple_hig,compact}*` — Delete 8 unused design renderer modules (~3,900 lines of dead code)
- `prune-designs-mod-rs` scope:`src/designs/mod.rs` — Remove mod/use declarations for deleted design renderers and DesignRenderer trait
- `rm-design-renderer-trait` scope:`src/designs/traits/parts.rs,src/designs/minimal.rs,src/designs/retro_terminal/parts.rs` — Delete DesignRenderer trait, its impls, and all `#![allow(dead_code)]` suppressions

NEXT_AREA: `src/designs/core/parts.rs` — `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations on helper functions may hide genuinely dead code

Want me to spawn these as a Codex swarm? Note that tasks 1 and 2 can run in parallel, but task 3 should run after both complete (it touches files that survive the deletion).
