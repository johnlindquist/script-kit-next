## Target Code

The two functions `load_apps_from_db()` (lines 118-195) and `load_apps_from_db_with_icons()` (lines 202-279) are completely identical — same SQL, same row mapping, same icon decoding, same iteration logic, same logging. The second one is even `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Additionally, every function in this file repeats the same `get_apps_db()` + `db.lock()` error-handling boilerplate 5 times.

FEATURE: SQLite app-launcher cache with duplicated DB access and two identical load functions
FILES: src/app_launcher/db_cache.rs
SMELL: `load_apps_from_db()` and `load_apps_from_db_with_icons()` are 77-line copy-paste clones (identical SQL, row mapping, icon decoding, and iteration), and the `get_apps_db()`+`db.lock()` error-handling stanza is repeated verbatim in all 5 functions

## Task: DRY violations: find duplicated logic across files, copy-pasted blocks, repeated boilerplate — extract into shared helpers and refactor call sites

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
