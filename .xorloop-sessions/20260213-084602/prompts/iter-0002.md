Here are the extracted swarm tasks:

- `scriptlet-template-escaping` scope:`src/scriptlets/mod.rs, src/executor/scriptlet.rs` — Implement per-shell-dialect escaping for template variable substitution to prevent RCE
- `secure-tempfiles-and-permissions` scope:`src/executor/scriptlet.rs, src/app_impl/execution_scripts.rs` — Use atomic random tempfiles with locked permissions; fix terminal command injection
- `path-traversal-hardening` scope:`src/scriptlets/mod.rs, src/app_impl/execution_scripts.rs` — Canonicalize scriptlet paths, reject traversal, enforce size limits
- `safer-deserialization-env` scope:`src/scriptlets/mod.rs, src/executor/scriptlet.rs` — Add deny_unknown_fields to YAML structs; env-clear child processes by default

NEXT_AREA: `open_terminal_with_command` implementation and scriptlet execution authorization gate

Do NOT repeat items already covered above. Find something new.
## Target Code

FEATURE: `execute_type()` builds AppleScript via `format!` with incomplete escaping (only `\` and `"`), allowing newline-based AppleScript injection from scriptlet content
FILES: src/executor/scriptlet.rs, src/app_execute/builtin_execution.rs
SMELL: `execute_type()` at line 794 escapes only backslash and double-quote before interpolating into an AppleScript string, while the codebase's own `applescript_escape()` in `builtin_execution.rs:26` also escapes `
`, ``, `	` — a multiline scriptlet value can inject arbitrary AppleScript commands via embedded newlines

## Task: security fix: find injection risks, authz gaps, secret leaks, unsafe deserialization, path traversal — write the patched code

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
