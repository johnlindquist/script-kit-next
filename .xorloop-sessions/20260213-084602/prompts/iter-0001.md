## Target Code

Now I have a clear picture. The `format_scriptlet` function performs direct string substitution of user inputs into shell scripts without any shell escaping — a textbook shell injection vulnerability.

FEATURE: Scriptlet execution substitutes user-provided input values directly into shell script content via `format_scriptlet()` without shell-escaping, enabling command injection through crafted `{{variable}}` values
FILES: src/scriptlets/mod.rs, src/executor/scriptlet.rs, src/app_impl/execution_scripts.rs
SMELL: `format_scriptlet()` at `src/scriptlets/mod.rs:1250` uses raw `str::replace()` to inject user inputs and positional args into shell scripts — a value like `$(rm -rf ~)` or `"; malicious_cmd; "` passes through unescaped into the temp file that gets executed by `execute_shell_scriptlet()`

## Task: security fix: find injection risks, authz gaps, secret leaks, unsafe deserialization, path traversal — write the patched code

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
