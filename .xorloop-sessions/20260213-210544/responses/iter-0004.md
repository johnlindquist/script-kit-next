Oracle's Chrome keeps closing. Since I have all the research already, I have enough context to generate the swarm tasks myself based on my thorough analysis. Let me produce the output directly.

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the dead code, here are the swarm tasks:

---

### Task 1: `rm-startup-new-files`

**Scope:** `src/app_impl/startup_new_*.rs`

**Task:**
Delete all five `startup_new_*.rs` files from `src/app_impl/`. These files — `startup_new_prelude.rs` (269 lines), `startup_new_arrow.rs` (412 lines), `startup_new_actions.rs` (338 lines), `startup_new_state.rs` (265 lines), and `startup_new_tab.rs` (200 lines) — are dead code totaling 1,484 lines. They are not declared as `mod` anywhere in the codebase (check `src/app_impl/mod.rs` — they're absent). `startup_new_state.rs` has a syntax error (stray `}` at line 225) proving it was never compiled. They exist only to be read as raw text by test assertions.

Simply `rm` (git-delete) these five files: `src/app_impl/startup_new_prelude.rs`, `src/app_impl/startup_new_arrow.rs`, `src/app_impl/startup_new_actions.rs`, `src/app_impl/startup_new_state.rs`, `src/app_impl/startup_new_tab.rs`. No `mod` declarations need updating because these files were never declared as modules.

Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Tests will fail (the source-audit tests that read these files will break) — that's expected and handled by Task 2. This task just deletes the dead files.

---

### Task 2: `fix-source-audit-tests`

**Scope:** `src/app_impl/tests.rs, src/keyboard_routing_tests.rs, src/list_state_init_tests.rs, src/clipboard_actions_focus_routing_tests.rs, src/webcam_actions_consistency_tests.rs`

**Task:**
Multiple test files read the now-deleted `startup_new_*.rs` files via `fs::read_to_string()` for string-matching assertions. Update every `fs::read_to_string("src/app_impl/startup_new_*.rs")` call to read `src/app_impl/startup.rs` instead — the real compiled module contains all the same patterns. Specifically:

In `src/app_impl/tests.rs`: Three tests on lines 52-95 — `test_shift_tab_routes_to_shared_ai_script_generation_handler`, `test_tab_still_routes_to_inline_ai_chat_in_script_list_tab_interceptor`, and `test_tab_interceptor_matches_both_tab_key_variants` — all read `"src/app_impl/startup_new_tab.rs"`. Change each to `"src/app_impl/startup.rs"`. The assertion strings (`"if has_shift"`, `"this.dispatch_ai_script_generation_from_query(query, cx);"`, `"this.show_inline_ai_chat(Some(query), cx);"`, `r#"matches!(event.keystroke.key.as_str(), "tab" | "Tab")"#`) all exist in `startup.rs` so the tests will still pass.

In `src/keyboard_routing_tests.rs`: The function `read_app_impl_sources()` (around line 22) reads 4 files: `startup_new_prelude.rs`, `startup_new_arrow.rs`, `startup_new_actions.rs`, and `actions_dialog.rs`. Replace the first three paths with the single path `"src/app_impl/startup.rs"` (keep `actions_dialog.rs` as-is since it's a real compiled file). The function concatenates all file contents into one string — keep the same approach but with the updated paths.

In `src/list_state_init_tests.rs`: The function `read_new_startup_sequence()` (around line 24) reads all 5 `startup_new_*.rs` files. Replace the entire file list with just `["src/app_impl/startup.rs"]`. The assertions check for `sync_list_state`, `validate_selection_bounds`, and ordering — all present in `startup.rs`.

In `src/clipboard_actions_focus_routing_tests.rs`: The function `read_app_impl_sources()` (around line 12) reads `startup_new_arrow.rs` and `startup_new_actions.rs`. Replace with `["src/app_impl/startup.rs"]`. Keep `actions_dialog.rs` if it's referenced.

In `src/webcam_actions_consistency_tests.rs`: Check if it reads any `startup_new_*.rs` files and update similarly. Based on analysis, this file reads `src/app_impl/webcam_actions.rs` (a real module) so it may not need changes — but verify.

After all changes, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` to confirm everything compiles and all tests pass.

---

### Task 3: `rm-duplicate-test-files`

**Scope:** `src/app_impl/keyboard_routing_tests.rs, src/app_impl/clipboard_actions_focus_routing_tests.rs, src/app_impl/tests/list_state_init.rs, src/app_impl/tests/webcam_actions_consistency.rs, src/app_impl/tests/`

**Task:**
Four test files exist as duplicates inside `src/app_impl/` that are NEVER compiled — they have no corresponding `mod` declaration in `src/app_impl/mod.rs`. The canonical (compiled) versions live at the crate root in `src/` and are declared in `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs`. Delete all four dead duplicates:

1. `src/app_impl/keyboard_routing_tests.rs` — identical copy of `src/keyboard_routing_tests.rs` (declared in `main.rs` line 60)
2. `src/app_impl/clipboard_actions_focus_routing_tests.rs` — near-identical copy of `src/clipboard_actions_focus_routing_tests.rs` (declared in `lib.rs` line 265), differs only in `//!` vs `//` comment style
3. `src/app_impl/tests/list_state_init.rs` — near-identical copy of `src/list_state_init_tests.rs` (declared in `main.rs` line 65), differs only in comment style
4. `src/app_impl/tests/webcam_actions_consistency.rs` — near-identical copy of `src/webcam_actions_consistency_tests.rs` (declared in `lib.rs` line 271), differs only in comment style

After deleting these 4 files, check if `src/app_impl/tests/` directory is now empty. If so, remove the empty directory. No `mod` declarations need updating — these files were never declared as modules in `mod.rs`. Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` — nothing should break since these files were never compiled.

---

### Task 4: `rm-stale-audit-docs`

**Scope:** `docs/audits/error-handling/*.md, docs/ai/layout-audit/*.md, docs/ai/prompt-analysis/*.md`

**Task:**
Several documentation/audit files reference specific line numbers in the now-deleted `startup_new_*.rs` files. These references are stale and misleading. The affected docs include: `docs/audits/error-handling/actions-dialog-shortcuts.md` (references `startup_new_actions.rs:227`), `docs/audits/error-handling/logging-correlation.md` (references `startup_new_state.rs:182`), `docs/audits/error-handling/action-execution-pipeline.md` (references `startup_new_actions.rs:217` and `startup_new_prelude.rs:257`), `docs/ai/layout-audit/other-prompt-shell-wrapper-audit.md` (references `startup_new_actions.rs:32` and `startup_new_actions.rs:204-215`), and `docs/ai/prompt-analysis/other-prompt-wrappers.md` (references `startup_new_actions.rs`).

For each of these files, find every reference to `startup_new_prelude.rs`, `startup_new_arrow.rs`, `startup_new_actions.rs`, `startup_new_state.rs`, or `startup_new_tab.rs` and replace the file path with `startup.rs`. Do NOT try to update line numbers — just change the filename. For example, `startup_new_actions.rs:227` becomes `startup.rs:227` (the line number will be approximate but the file reference will be correct). If a doc file has been deleted or doesn't exist, skip it silently.

Verify the changes don't break any build or tests: `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

---

NEXT_AREA: `actions_button_visibility_tests.rs` / `clipboard_actions_menu_coverage_tests.rs` in `src/lib.rs` — additional source-audit test modules that may use the same brittle `fs::read_to_string()` + `.contains()` pattern against other non-compiled files. Worth auditing whether they reference any other phantom `.rs` files that don't exist as compiled modules.
