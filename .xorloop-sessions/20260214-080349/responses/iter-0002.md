Good — there's plenty more dead code. But the task was scoped to system_actions and surroundings. Let me now produce the validated swarm task list, correcting Oracle's mistakes.

Here are the validated swarm tasks from the Oracle analysis (with corrections for false positives):

---

### Task 1: `system-actions-prune`

**Scope:** `src/system_actions/mod.rs`

**Task:**
`src/system_actions/mod.rs` contains 10+ public functions that are never called from any production code path outside the module. These functions were written speculatively for a Force Quit UI and volume controls but were never wired into `SystemActionType` dispatch. The dead functions are: `get_running_apps()` (line ~252), `get_bundle_id_from_path()` (helper for get_running_apps), `force_quit_app()` (line ~439), `force_quit_app_by_name()` (line ~499), `volume_up()` (line ~520), `volume_down()` (line ~528), `get_volume()` (line ~555), `is_muted()` (line ~564), `open_general_settings()` (line ~675), `open_dock_settings()` (line ~680), `open_battery_settings()` (line ~685), `open_trackpad_settings()` (line ~690). Also dead: the `AppInfo` struct (used only by get_running_apps).

Delete all the above functions, the `AppInfo` struct, and the `get_bundle_id_from_path` helper. Also delete unit tests that only exercise these removed APIs: `test_volume_controls_integration`, `test_get_running_apps_*`, `test_force_quit_app*`. Clean up stale imports that become unused after deletion (expect `sysinfo` and `serde` imports to become orphaned once `AppInfo`/`get_running_apps` are gone). Remove any `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations that were suppressing warnings on these items.

Do **NOT** delete `run_applescript_with_output`, `is_dark_mode`, `set_volume`, `volume_mute`, `force_quit_apps` (plural — the one that opens a system dialog), `open_system_preferences_main`, `open_accessibility_settings`, `open_display_settings`, `open_sound_settings`, or `open_notifications_settings` — these ARE dispatched from `builtin_execution.rs` and `builtin_confirmation.rs`. After all removals, run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` to verify nothing breaks.

### Task 2: `rm-orphan-feature-files`

**Scope:** `src/app_execute/builtin_execution/feature_*.rs`

**Task:**
The directory `src/app_execute/builtin_execution/` contains three files: `feature_01.rs`, `feature_02.rs`, and `feature_03.rs`. These are orphaned — there are no `mod feature_01;` declarations, no `include!()` statements, and no `use` imports referencing them anywhere in the codebase. The parent module `src/app_execute/builtin_execution.rs` is a flat file (not a `mod.rs` facade), so the directory's files are never compiled. They appear to be speculative splits of builtin execution logic that were never wired in. The real implementation lives entirely in `builtin_execution.rs`.

Delete all three files: `src/app_execute/builtin_execution/feature_01.rs`, `feature_02.rs`, and `feature_03.rs`. If the directory becomes empty after deletion, delete the directory itself. Before deleting, do a final confirmation grep for `feature_01`, `feature_02`, `feature_03` across the repo to ensure nothing references them. Run `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` afterward — these files were never compiled so removal should be clean.

NEXT_AREA: `src/editor/mod.rs` — has 11 `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations worth auditing for genuinely unused methods
