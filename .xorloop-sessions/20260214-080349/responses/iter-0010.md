The Oracle response was truncated — it only returned a preamble. The actual work orders didn't make it through. That's fine — I have all the analysis I need from my own investigation. Let me produce the swarm tasks directly.

Here are the swarm tasks based on my thorough analysis:

---

### Task 1: `rm-dead-blocking-exec`

**Scope:** `src/executor/runner.rs`

**Task:**
The file `src/executor/runner.rs` contains two blocking execution functions that are never called in production. `execute_script()` (lines 769-852) is a non-interactive blocking script runner annotated `#[allow(dead_code)]` that uses `run_command()` as its execution callback. `run_command()` (lines 854-912) is a blocking command runner also annotated `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Neither function is called from anywhere outside this file except by each other (`execute_script` calls `run_command` via the `run_fallback_chain` callback at line 835). Production code exclusively uses `execute_script_interactive()`. Additionally, `ensure_tsconfig_paths()` at lines 128-132 is a private no-op stub with `#[allow(dead_code)]` and a comment saying "Setup module now handles this" — never called anywhere.

Delete these three items: (1) the `ensure_tsconfig_paths` function (lines 128-132), (2) the entire `execute_script` function (lines 769-852 including the `#[allow(dead_code)]` and `#[instrument]` attributes), (3) the entire `run_command` function (lines 854-912 including attributes). After deletion, check if any imports at the top of the file become unused — specifically `Instant` may still be needed by `execute_script_interactive`, and the `#[cfg(unix)]` import of `CommandExt` is used by `spawn_script`. Remove only imports that become truly orphaned. Also remove the test module `env_scrub_tests` (lines 1053-1135) which contains `test_run_command_forwards_script_kit_vars_when_env_is_scrubbed` that tests `run_command` — the other test in that module (`test_spawn_script_forwards_script_kit_vars_when_env_is_scrubbed`) tests `spawn_script` which is still live, so extract that test into a new `#[cfg(test)] mod spawn_env_tests` block or keep it in the same module but remove the `use super::run_command` import.

Do NOT touch `execute_script_interactive`, `spawn_script`, `run_fallback_chain`, `RuntimeAttempt`, `ProcessHandle`, `ScriptSession`, `SplitSession`, or any of their methods. Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

---

### Task 2: `rm-dead-session-methods`

**Scope:** `src/executor/runner.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/executor/runner.rs`, the `impl ScriptSession` block at lines 503-571 (annotated `#[allow(dead_code)]`) contains six methods: `send_message`, `receive_message`, `is_running`, `wait`, `kill`, and `pid`. These methods are NEVER called in production code. Production code at `src/execute_script/mod.rs:200` immediately calls `session.split()` to destructure into `SplitSession` and then accesses the fields directly (`split.stdin`, `split.stdout_reader`, `split.stderr`, `split.process_handle`, `split.child`). The methods in this impl are only referenced in test files (`runner_integration_tests.rs` and `executor/tests/integration.rs`).

Delete the entire `#[allow(dead_code)] impl ScriptSession` block at lines 503-571. This block includes: `send_message()`, `receive_message()`, `is_running()`, `wait()`, `kill()`, and `pid()`. After deletion, check if the `use crate::protocol::{serialize_message, JsonlReader, Message}` import needs adjusting — `JsonlReader` and `Message` are still used by `ScriptSession` struct definition and `SplitSession`, but `serialize_message` may only be used by the deleted `send_message()`. If `serialize_message` is no longer used in this file, remove it from the import. Also check if `std::io::Write` becomes unused (it was needed for `writeln!` in `send_message`).

Do NOT touch the `ScriptSession` struct definition (lines 419-427), the `ScriptSession::split()` method (lines 442-461), or the `SplitSession` struct and its impl block. The `SplitSession` methods (`is_running`, `kill`, `wait`, `pid` at lines 463-501) ARE used in tests for a live struct — leave them. Also update `src/executor/runner_integration_tests.rs` and `src/executor/tests/integration.rs` — they call `session.send_message()` and `session.receive_message()` which will no longer exist. Either delete those test functions entirely OR rewrite them to use `split.stdin` and `split.stdout_reader` directly instead.

Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

### Task 3: `rm-dead-crash-infra`

**Scope:** `src/executor/errors.rs, src/executor/mod.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/executor/errors.rs`, lines 200-367 contain unused "crash infrastructure" that was never integrated: `CrashInfo` struct (line 208), its impl block (lines 222-287), `signal_to_name()` (lines 290-309), and `generate_crash_suggestions()` (lines 312-367). All are annotated `#[allow(dead_code)]` with comments saying "Infrastructure ready for integration into main.rs" — but they were never integrated. `CrashInfo` and `generate_crash_suggestions` are not called from any production or test code outside `errors.rs`. `signal_to_name()` is only called by `CrashInfo::error_message()` which is itself dead. Note that `generate_suggestions()` (lines 92-198) already handles signal-based exit codes inline with a similar `match signal` — the crash infrastructure duplicates this.

Delete: (1) the `CrashInfo` struct and its `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotation (lines 200-219), (2) the entire `impl CrashInfo` block (lines 221-287), (3) the `signal_to_name()` function (lines 289-309), (4) the `generate_crash_suggestions()` function (lines 311-367). In `src/executor/mod.rs`, remove the re-export line `pub use errors::{generate_crash_suggestions, signal_to_name, CrashInfo};` (line 30) and its `#[allow(unused_imports)]` annotation (line 29). After removal, verify no imports in `errors.rs` become unused — the existing `use crate::utils::truncate_str_chars` is used by `extract_error_message` which stays.

Do NOT touch `parse_stack_trace`, `extract_error_message`, `generate_suggestions`, or the test module. Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

---

### Task 4: `rm-stale-mod-exports`

**Scope:** `src/executor/mod.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/executor/mod.rs`, lines 34-38 re-export dead items from `runner.rs` under the comment "Additional runner exports for testing and backwards compatibility". After Tasks 1-2 remove `execute_script` and `run_command` from `runner.rs`, these re-exports will cause compilation errors. Even before those removals, the re-exports are stale.

Change the re-export block at lines 34-38 from:
```rust
// Additional runner exports for testing and backwards compatibility
#[allow(unused_imports)]
pub use runner::{
    execute_script, find_executable, find_sdk_path, is_javascript, is_typescript, run_command,
    spawn_script, ProcessHandle, SplitSession,
};
```
to only export items that are actually used externally or in tests:
```rust
pub use runner::{
    find_executable, find_sdk_path, is_javascript, is_typescript, spawn_script, ProcessHandle,
    SplitSession,
};
```
Remove `execute_script` and `run_command` from this list. Remove the `#[allow(unused_imports)]` annotation — the remaining items ARE used. Remove the "backwards compatibility" comment. Also verify that `find_executable`, `find_sdk_path`, `is_javascript`, `is_typescript`, `spawn_script`, `ProcessHandle`, and `SplitSession` are actually used outside the executor module (they are: `spawn_script` by `execute_script/mod.rs`, `SplitSession` by `execute_script/mod.rs`, etc.). If any item in the trimmed list triggers an unused-import warning from clippy, remove it too.

Verify with `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`.

---

NEXT_AREA: `src/executor/scriptlet.rs` — the `execute_*` dispatch functions (~20 functions, ~600 lines) likely contain duplicated patterns (env setup, error formatting, process spawning) that could be consolidated, plus `shell_not_found_suggestions()` may be dead if no caller exists outside the scriptlet module.
