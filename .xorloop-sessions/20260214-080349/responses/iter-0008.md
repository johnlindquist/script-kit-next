This test is checking a different implementation (`src/render_script_list/part_000.rs`), not the `prompt_header/component.rs` version. The `prompt_header` version DOES have cursor_pointer on the "Ask AI" hints — confirming this is a real inconsistency. The same hint is non-clickable by design (as the test says), but the `prompt_header` version uses cursor_pointer.

Now I have all 4 solid findings. Let me compile the swarm task list. Oracle timed out, so I'll produce the analysis directly.

Here are the swarm tasks extracted from the analysis:

---

### Task 1: `fix-toast-dead-details-toggle`

**Scope:** `src/components/toast/render.rs, src/components/toast/model.rs, src/components/toast/types.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/components/toast/render.rs` lines 134-139, the "View details" / "Hide details" toggle element applies `.cursor_pointer()` and `.hover(|s| s.underline())` but has NO `.on_click()` handler. Since `Toast` is `#[derive(IntoElement)]` (RenderOnce), there is no mutable state path to toggle `details_expanded`. Users see a clickable-looking element that does nothing. The fix: since `details_expanded` cannot be toggled at runtime (Toast is consumed on render), remove the misleading interactive affordances. Remove `.cursor_pointer()` and `.hover(|s| s.underline())` from the details toggle div at lines 137-138, and remove the `details_expanded` builder method from `model.rs` (line 91-94) and the field from the struct (line 33) since they serve no purpose. Set `details_expanded` to always be `true` when `details.is_some()` — if the toast has details, show them immediately.

The exact change in `render.rs`: replace the details toggle block (lines 127-142) with a block that does NOT render the toggle text at all. Instead, the existing details section at lines 183-203 should be shown unconditionally when `self.details.is_some()`. Remove the `let has_details` and `let details_expanded` locals (lines 17-18). Remove the entire `if has_details { ... }` block (lines 127-142). Change the condition at line 183 from `if details_expanded` to `if let Some(details_text) = self.details`. In `model.rs`, remove the `details_expanded` field (line 33), its initialization in `new()` (line 52), and the `details_expanded()` builder method (lines 91-94). Keep `details`, `details_opt`, and `get_details` methods. Make sure `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` passes. The toast test file is at `src/components/toast/tests.rs` — check for any test references to `details_expanded` and update them.

### Task 2: `fix-header-askhi-cursor`

**Scope:** `src/components/prompt_header/component.rs, src/components/prompt_header/tests.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/components/prompt_header/component.rs`, the `render_ask_ai_hint()` method (starting at line 314) renders two div elements — "Ask AI" (line 330) and "Tab" (line 351) — both with `.cursor_pointer()`. These are visual hints, NOT interactive buttons. A test in `src/app_actions/tests/actions_button_visibility.rs` at line 58 (`test_ask_ai_hint_is_non_clickable_visual_hint`) explicitly asserts that the "Ask AI" hint should use `.cursor_default()` and should NOT use `.cursor_pointer()`. The prompt_header version violates this convention. Neither element has an `on_click` handler — they're purely decorative hints that suggest "press Tab to enter AI mode."

The fix: In `src/components/prompt_header/component.rs`, change `.cursor_pointer()` on line 330 to `.cursor_default()`, and change `.cursor_pointer()` on line 351 to `.cursor_default()`. Also update the existing test in `src/components/prompt_header/tests.rs` at line 50-58 (`test_render_ask_ai_hint_uses_pointer_cursor_for_hint_buttons`) which currently asserts there are exactly 2 `cursor_pointer` occurrences. That test should be renamed to `test_render_ask_ai_hint_uses_default_cursor_for_hint_buttons` and should assert there are 0 `cursor_pointer` and exactly 2 `cursor_default` occurrences. Make sure `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` passes.

### Task 3: `fix-button-transparent-rgba`

**Scope:** `src/components/button/component.rs, src/components/unified_list_item/render.rs, src/prompts/chat/render_setup.rs`

**Task:**
Several files use the hardcoded literal `rgba(0x00000000)` for transparent backgrounds instead of using a named constant. This scattered magic number makes it unclear whether the value is intentional transparent or a forgotten placeholder. In `src/components/button/component.rs` lines 247 and 256, the Ghost and Icon button variants use `rgba(0x00000000)` for their unfocused backgrounds. In `src/components/unified_list_item/render.rs` lines 128 and 216, the list item uses `rgba(0x00000000)` for non-selected/non-hovered states. In `src/prompts/chat/render_setup.rs` lines 92 and 150, the chat setup buttons use `rgba(0x00000000)` for unfocused borders.

The fix: Add a `pub(crate) const TRANSPARENT: u32 = 0x00000000;` constant at the top of `src/components/button/component.rs` (or in the button types module if one exists). Then replace all 6 instances of the literal `0x00000000` with `TRANSPARENT` in those three files. Import the constant in `unified_list_item/render.rs` and `chat/render_setup.rs` via `use crate::components::button::TRANSPARENT;`. Alternatively, if there's already a shared constants module, put it there. The key constraint: do NOT change any runtime behavior — `rgba(TRANSPARENT)` must produce the exact same result as `rgba(0x00000000)`. Make sure `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` passes after the change.

### Task 4: `fix-toast-hardcoded-menlo`

**Scope:** `src/components/toast/render.rs`

**Task:**
In `src/components/toast/render.rs` line 196, the details section uses `.font_family("Menlo")` as a hardcoded string literal. The codebase has an existing constant `FONT_MONO` defined in `src/list_item/mod.rs` at line 286 as `pub(crate) const FONT_MONO: &str = "SF Mono"`. This is a convention inconsistency — the toast details section uses a different monospace font ("Menlo") than the rest of the app ("SF Mono"). Since `FONT_MONO` is the canonical monospace font constant used by list items and the script list, the toast should use it too for visual consistency.

The fix: In `src/components/toast/render.rs`, add an import `use crate::list_item::FONT_MONO;` at the top of the file (after the existing imports around lines 1-10). Then on line 196, replace `.font_family("Menlo")` with `.font_family(FONT_MONO)`. This changes the toast details font from Menlo to SF Mono, matching the rest of the app. Make sure `cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` passes. If any toast tests in `src/components/toast/tests.rs` assert on the font family string, update them to expect `FONT_MONO` / "SF Mono" instead of "Menlo".

NEXT_AREA: `src/prompts/chat/state.rs` — the chat suggestion chips (line ~270) and remove-chip button (line ~457) have click handlers but appear to use hardcoded colors and inconsistent hover patterns compared to other interactive elements in the chat render files
