Here are the validated swarm tasks:

- `system-actions-prune` scope:`src/system_actions/mod.rs` — Delete 12+ dead functions, AppInfo struct, and their tests from system_actions
- `rm-orphan-feature-files` scope:`src/app_execute/builtin_execution/feature_*.rs` — Delete 3 orphaned feature files never compiled or referenced

NEXT_AREA: `src/editor/mod.rs` — has 11 `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations worth auditing for genuinely unused methods

Want me to execute these as a swarm, or run them sequentially?
