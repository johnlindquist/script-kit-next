Looking at the analysis, here are the swarm tasks:

- `fix-regex-lazy-lock` scope:`src/scripts/input_detection/detection.rs` — Hoist two per-call Regex::new into static LazyLock declarations
- `rm-dead-search-helpers` scope:`src/scripts/search/{nucleo,ascii}.rs` — Delete deprecated nucleo_score, cfg(test)-gate dead ascii helpers
- `dedup-type-order-unified` scope:`src/scripts/search/unified.rs` — Extract duplicated type_order closure into standalone function
- `name-score-constants` scope:`src/scripts/search/{scripts,scriptlets}.rs` — Replace ~40 magic score literals with named constants

NEXT_AREA: `src/scripts/search/builtins.rs` and `src/scripts/search/apps.rs` scoring patterns — likely have same magic-number problem and duplicated logic that could unify into a shared scoring helper module
