Let me extract the swarm tasks from this analysis.

---

- `dedup-positioning-bounds` scope:`src/platform/positioning.rs` — Deduplicate eye-line and centered bounds into shared helper with placement enum
- `dedup-vibrancy-config` scope:`src/platform/secondary_window_config.rs` — Extract common vibrancy config steps from actions popup and secondary window functions
- `dedup-screenshot-encode` scope:`src/platform/screenshots_window_open.rs` — Extract shared capture-scale-encode PNG pipeline into helper function
- `name-appkit-constants` scope:`src/platform/app_window_management.rs, src/platform/vibrancy_swizzle_materials.rs, src/platform/secondary_window_config.rs` — Replace raw AppKit numeric literals with named constants across platform files

NEXT_AREA: `src/platform/ai_commands.rs` capture/encode duplication (same pattern as screenshot but in different include file)
