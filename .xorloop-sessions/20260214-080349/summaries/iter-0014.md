Here are the swarm tasks:

- `panel-prune-dead-code` scope:`src/panel.rs` — Delete dead types/fns hidden by blanket `#![allow(dead_code)]` and prune orphaned tests
- `remove-window-control-enhanced` scope:`src/window_control_enhanced/**, src/lib.rs, Cargo.toml, CODEMAP.md` — Delete dead feature-gated module and all references

NEXT_AREA: `src/app_launcher/` — `db_cache.rs`, `icon_cache.rs`, `scanning.rs`, and `core_types.rs` all have `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions and may contain orphaned types/functions from earlier architectural iterations.

Want me to execute these as a swarm?
