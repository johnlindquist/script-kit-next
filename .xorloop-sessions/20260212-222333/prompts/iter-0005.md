- **`browser.rs` is dead code**: exists with GitHub search API logic but isn't declared in `mod.rs`, never compiled. The actual kit store UI in `render_builtins/kit_store.rs` duplicates git operations inline instead of using `git_ops.rs`.

- **Structs and functions lack field/error docs**: `KitManifest`, `InstalledKit`, `KitSearchResult` have no field-level `///` comments. All 8 public fallible functions missing `/// # Errors` sections. `git_ops.rs` uses `Result<_, String>` while siblings use `anyhow::Result`.

- **Filesystem path logic is inconsistent**: `discover.rs` hardcodes `dirs::home_dir().join(".scriptkit")`, `git_ops.rs` falls back to literal `"~"` (not shell-expanded), and `storage.rs` uses `get_kit_path()`. No canonical layout documented anywhere.

NEXT_SEED: `src/render_builtins/kit_store.rs` — duplicated git logic and architectural debt vs `kit_store/git_ops.rs`
---
- **Unbounded file reads and malformed JSON** can cause OOM/DoS or permanently brick frecency data; fix with file size caps (5 MiB), quarantine-and-reset on parse errors, and skip-deserializing the derived `score` field.
- **Symlink attacks and permission leaks** in the save path due to deterministic temp filenames and default permissions; fix with `tempfile::NamedTempFile` (O_EXCL) and 0o600 permissions, plus fsync before rename.
- **Unbounded growth and input quirks** from no entry count cap, no key validation, future timestamp pinning, and integer overflow in pruning; fix with MAX_ENTRIES/MAX_KEY_BYTES limits, timestamp clamping, and saturating arithmetic.

NEXT_SEED: Script execution pipeline — command injection, unsafe env var exposure, and filesystem permission assumptions in script launching and built-in command handling.
---
- **Critical thread-safety gap**: `apply_default_cursor()` is public and callable from any thread, but AppKit's `[NSCursor set]` requires the main thread — leads to undefined behavior. Also missing autorelease pools and using panicking `class!()` macro instead of fallible `Class::get()`.

- **Cursor claims lack window scoping and lifecycle cleanup**: Components call `claim_cursor_pointer()` unconditionally without checking window type (NSPanel vs normal), and there's no cursor reset on panel hide/close/deactivate — leaving a sticky pointer cursor (UI spoofing vector).

- **API over-exposure and missing optimization**: `claim_cursor_pointer()` and `apply_default_cursor()` are fully `pub` (should be `pub(crate)` or capability-gated), no caching means redundant AppKit calls on every mouse move, and the binary arrow/pointer model can't express I-beam for text regions.

NEXT_SEED: Popup root wiring and NSPanel window lifecycle hooks — verifying main-thread guarantees, cursor resets on hide/close/deactivate, and event-propagation contract integrity.

## Feature Under Review

FEATURE: Floating notes window with SQLite-backed persistence, markdown editing, full-text search (FTS5), quick capture, soft delete, and keyboard-driven navigation
FILES: src/notes/mod.rs, src/notes/model.rs, src/notes/storage.rs, src/notes/window.rs, src/notes/markdown.rs

## Analysis Category

performance: look for O(n^2), repeated I/O, unbounded loops, heavy regex, unnecessary allocations

## Instructions

1. Analyze the feature described above through the lens of: performance
2. Be specific: reference actual file paths, function names, line ranges
3. Output a prioritized checklist of actionable improvements
4. For each item: severity (critical/major/minor), file path, concrete fix description
5. End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
