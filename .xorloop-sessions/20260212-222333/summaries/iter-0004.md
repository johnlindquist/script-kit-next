- **Critical thread-safety gap**: `apply_default_cursor()` is public and callable from any thread, but AppKit's `[NSCursor set]` requires the main thread — leads to undefined behavior. Also missing autorelease pools and using panicking `class!()` macro instead of fallible `Class::get()`.

- **Cursor claims lack window scoping and lifecycle cleanup**: Components call `claim_cursor_pointer()` unconditionally without checking window type (NSPanel vs normal), and there's no cursor reset on panel hide/close/deactivate — leaving a sticky pointer cursor (UI spoofing vector).

- **API over-exposure and missing optimization**: `claim_cursor_pointer()` and `apply_default_cursor()` are fully `pub` (should be `pub(crate)` or capability-gated), no caching means redundant AppKit calls on every mouse move, and the binary arrow/pointer model can't express I-beam for text regions.
