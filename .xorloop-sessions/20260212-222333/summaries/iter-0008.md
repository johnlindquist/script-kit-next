I need to understand what "this analysis" refers to. Looking at the context, the most relevant analysis is the git status and recent work shown in the system prompt. Let me summarize:

- The codebase has active uncommitted changes across dialog actions, button components, footer/prompt UI, platform modules, and render implementation — plus several untracked files including cursor support and progress tests.
- Recent commits focus on emoji picker functionality: grid navigation, arrow key routing, spacer cells, non-dismissable behavior, and extracting scroll helpers — indicating an active UI feature buildout.
- The project follows strict conventions: mandatory verification gates (check/clippy/test), no unwrap in production, stdin JSON protocol for UI testing, and semantic module splitting instead of numbered part files.

NEXT_SEED: the untracked `src/platform/cursor.rs` module and its integration with the platform layer
