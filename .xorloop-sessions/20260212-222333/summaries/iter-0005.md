Here's the summary:

- **Critical DB/UI thread blocking**: FTS triggers fire unnecessarily on every upsert (not just content changes), and synchronous SQLite writes plus per-keystroke queries block the render loop, causing UI jank.
- **Redundant per-frame computation**: Full-buffer scans for stats, lowercase content matching, and markdown re-parsing happen every render frame instead of being cached and invalidated on change.
- **Excessive allocations in hot paths**: Unnecessary string clones on keystrokes, double allocations from `NoteId::as_str()`, per-comparison `to_lowercase()` in sorts, and full-content clones for delete/restore waste memory in tight loops.

NEXT_SEED: CommandBar action filtering and ranking performance — whether it loads full note content or metadata-only rows, and virtualization of action list rendering.
