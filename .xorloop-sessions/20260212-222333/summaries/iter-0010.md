- **Auto-execution without consent is the top risk**: scripts self-authorize via inline metadata (`// schedule:`), spawned processes inherit all env vars (secrets), and output is unbounded in memory — enabling silent data exfiltration, OOM crashes, and credential leakage from cloned script packs.

- **No resource limits or integrity checks create DoS and tampering vectors**: zero concurrency caps allow process explosion, TOCTOU races let files be swapped between scheduling and execution, stale schedules are never pruned, and symlinks can escape the scripts directory.

- **Runtime resolution and parsing have exploitable gaps**: `BUN_PATH` env var allows trojan binary substitution, full-file reads for metadata enable OOM on large files, and failed cron parses loop indefinitely every 30 seconds without backoff.
