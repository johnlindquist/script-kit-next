- **Critical safety docs needed**: Three files (`keystroke_logger.rs`, `text_injector.rs`, `keyword_manager/mod.rs`) lack safety/privacy documentation for sensitive operations — keystroke recording, synthetic input injection to focused apps, clipboard overwrites, and system-wide keyboard monitoring requiring Accessibility permissions.

- **14 major API/architecture gaps**: Public structs and functions across the text-expansion pipeline are undocumented — no `///` docs, no module-level `//!` architecture overviews, no `# Errors` sections, and no explanation of the dataflow (monitor → matcher → lookup → substitution → injector) or threading model.

- **Minor polish items**: Five items covering missing usage examples for keystroke logger, text injector, keyword matcher, and scriptlet formatting, plus one stale `// Public API for future use` comment that should be removed or converted to a stability note.
