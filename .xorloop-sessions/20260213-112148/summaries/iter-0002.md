Good. Now I have the full picture of what's already been done and what remains. Here's the updated task list:

---

- `extract-has-actions-arg` scope:`src/render_prompts/arg/*.rs` — Replace 2 unwrap-based has_actions checks with is_some_and in arg render files
- `rm-dead-box-shadows` scope:`src/render_builtins/*.rs, src/app_render/preview_metadata.rs` — Delete 8 dead create_box_shadows() calls and their comments

NEXT_AREA: `create_box_shadows()` method definition itself — if all callers are dead, the method may be unused and removable
