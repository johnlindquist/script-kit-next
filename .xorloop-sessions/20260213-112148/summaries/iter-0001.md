All 4 extraction tasks from the analysis have already been completed:

- `d3c874b6` — extract SDK shortcut match helper
- `bec692ae` — extract key preamble helper
- `c332845b` — extract prompt token setup context
- `db468ab3` — extract actions backdrop overlay helper

There are **no remaining swarm tasks** — all 4 concrete implementation tasks identified in the analysis were already committed to `main`.

NEXT_AREA: render_prompts layout duplication — the shared helpers extract logic, but the layout builders (panel dimensions, scrollable regions, item row rendering) likely still have copy-paste patterns across the 6 files worth auditing.
