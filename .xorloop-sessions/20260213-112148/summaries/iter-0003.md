Now I have full context on all the affected code. Here's the swarm task list:

---

- `dir-entry-errors` scope:`src/file_search/mod.rs` — Log swallowed ReadDir and metadata errors in directory listing functions
- `mdfind-metadata-errors` scope:`src/file_search/mod.rs` — Log swallowed metadata/timestamp errors in mdfind search functions
- `utility-time-cwd-errors` scope:`src/file_search/mod.rs` — Log swallowed errors in get_file_metadata, expand_path, and format_relative_time

NEXT_AREA: silent drops from `PathBuf::to_str()` returning `None` in both `list_directory` and `list_directory_streaming` — non-UTF8 paths currently become invisible with zero diagnostics

---

Want me to spawn a swarm to implement all three tasks in parallel?
