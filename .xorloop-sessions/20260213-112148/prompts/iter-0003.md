All 4 extraction tasks from the analysis have already been completed:

- `d3c874b6` — extract SDK shortcut match helper
- `bec692ae` — extract key preamble helper
- `c332845b` — extract prompt token setup context
- `db468ab3` — extract actions backdrop overlay helper

There are **no remaining swarm tasks** — all 4 concrete implementation tasks identified in the analysis were already committed to `main`.

NEXT_AREA: render_prompts layout duplication — the shared helpers extract logic, but the layout builders (panel dimensions, scrollable regions, item row rendering) likely still have copy-paste patterns across the 6 files worth auditing.

Good. Now I have the full picture of what's already been done and what remains. Here's the updated task list:

---

- `extract-has-actions-arg` scope:`src/render_prompts/arg/*.rs` — Replace 2 unwrap-based has_actions checks with is_some_and in arg render files
- `rm-dead-box-shadows` scope:`src/render_builtins/*.rs, src/app_render/preview_metadata.rs` — Delete 8 dead create_box_shadows() calls and their comments

NEXT_AREA: `create_box_shadows()` method definition itself — if all callers are dead, the method may be unused and removable

Do NOT repeat items already covered above. Find something new.
## Target Code

FEATURE: `file_search/mod.rs` silently swallows all filesystem errors (metadata, modified-time, cwd) via `.ok()?` and `.unwrap_or(0)` chains, producing incorrect search results with zero diagnostic output.
FILES: src/file_search/mod.rs
SMELL: At least 5 call sites (lines 315-327, 505-517, 616-628, 676-681, 1154-1165) discard `std::fs::metadata` and `std::env::current_dir` errors with bare `.ok()` / `.unwrap_or((0,0))` — no logging, no context, silently returning wrong sizes/timestamps to the UI.

## Task: error handling fix: find missing guards, unchecked returns, brittle parsing, swallowed errors — write the corrected code with proper error handling

## CONTEXT: You are generating work orders for a codex-swarm

Your output will be handed DIRECTLY to a `/codex-swarm` dispatcher that spawns parallel Codex AI agents (GPT-5.3) to implement your recommendations. Each task you write becomes a worker that edits real files autonomously. The workers have NO context beyond what you write in the task description — they cannot ask questions.

## Output Format — SWARM TASK LIST

Output 1-4 tasks. For each task, output this EXACT structure:

### Task N: `<worker-id>`

**Scope:** `<glob pattern for files this worker should touch>`

**Task:**
<2-4 paragraphs briefing a senior engineer. Be EXHAUSTIVE — the worker has zero context beyond this text.>

<Paragraph 1: What is wrong, which specific files/functions/lines are involved, and what the fix should accomplish.>

<Paragraph 2: The exact implementation — what code to change, what the replacement should look like, what patterns to follow from the existing codebase. Include function signatures, variable names, types.>

<Paragraph 3: Edge cases and constraints — what NOT to break, what to watch out for, how to verify the fix works.>

## Rules

- Worker IDs must be short kebab-case: `fix-fts-trigger`, `add-search-debounce`, `rm-dead-exports`
- Scope must be a glob: `src/notes/storage.rs`, `src/auth/**/*.ts`, `src/menu_bar/*.rs`
- Each worker should own at most ~10 files. If a fix spans more, split into multiple tasks
- Task descriptions must be SELF-CONTAINED — include file paths, function names, current buggy code snippets, and what the corrected code should look like
- Do NOT suggest adding documentation, comments, or docstrings — only functional code changes
- Do NOT suggest adding logging unless it fixes an actual bug
- Prioritize by impact: bugs > security > performance > cleanup
- Maximum 4 tasks per iteration — fewer is better if they're high-quality
- End with: NEXT_AREA: <suggest one unexplored area for future analysis>
